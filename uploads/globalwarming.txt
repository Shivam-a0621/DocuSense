Preface 
 
Global Warming becomes the field of attent ion for many modern societies, power and 
energy engineers, academicians, researchers and stakeholders. Everywhere, major 
problems of depletion of fossil fuel resource s, poor energy efficiency and environmental 
pollution are required to be attended on priority. This book is written to create 
awareness to the energy engineers, academicia ns, researchers, indust rials and society as 
a whole. It lays emphasis on the current st atus of global warming and its impact on 
climate changes. We all know that humanities  are at risk due to Green House Gases and 
are a main cause of Global Warming. Our beau tiful Earth Planet is being destroyed, due 
to excessive exploration of earth’s reservoirs and other serious manmade problems.  
The main objective of this book is to prod uce a good document from the point of view 
of knowledge seeker or public readers at large end for those who are eager to know 
much about Global Warming and its impact  on the Climate Changes, besides those 
who have raisen their voice for its reme dial measures. Some of the general and 
important burning areas about the Global Warming issues are:  
i. What is Global Warming?  
ii. Is Global Warming, caused by human activity, even remotely plausible?  
iii. What are the Greenhouse Gases?  
iv. How much have we increased the Atmosphere's CO 2 Concentration?  
v. Is the Temperature Really  Changing?  
vi. Is there a connection between the re cent drought and climate change?  
vii. Global Warming Impacts, Discussing global climate changes, Response of 
Government. 
viii. Possible Problems with Carbon "Sequestration" 
Although we know that Global Warming is  t h e  i n c r e a s e  o f  E a r t h ' s  a v e r a g e  s u r f a c e  
temperature due to the effect of Greenhous e Gases such as: Carbon Dioxide through 
emissions produced from burning of fossil fuels or from deforestation, which traps 
heat that would otherwise escape the Earth. This is a type of Greenhouse Effect . The 
most significant Greenhouse Gas is actually Water Vapor , not something produced 
directly by humankind in significant amou nts. However, even slight increase in 
atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2) can cause a substantial increase in Earth’s 
atmospheric temperature.  X Preface  
 
There are two reasons for global rise in Earth’s atmospheric temperature: First, 
although the concentration of these gases is not nearly as large as that of Oxygen and 
Nitrogen (the main constituents of the at mosphere), neither Oxygen nor Nitrogen is 
greenhouse gas. This is because neither has more than two atoms per molecule (i.e. 
their molecular forms are O 2 and N 2, respectively), and so they lack the internal 
vibrational modes  that molecules with more  than two atoms have. Both water and CO 2, 
for example, have these "internal vibratio nal modes", and these vibrational modes can 
absorb and re-radiate infrared radiation,  which causes the greenhouse effect.   
Secondly, CO 2 tends to remain in the atmosphere fo r a very long time (time scaled in 
hundreds of years). Water vapor, on the othe r hand, can easily condense or evaporate, 
depending upon local conditions. Water vapor levels, therefore, tend to adjust quickly 
to the prevailing conditions, such that the energy flows fr om the Sun and re-radiation 
from the Earth achieves a balance. CO 2 tends to remain fairly constant and therefore 
behaves as a controlling factor, rather than a reacting  factor. More CO 2 means that the 
balance occurs at higher temperature and water vapor levels. The ultimate effects 
which we are likely to face as 21st Century challenges are: 
1. Rising Seas --- inundation of fresh water ma rshlands (the ev erglades), low-
lying cities, and islands with seawater. 
2. Changes in rainfall patterns  - - -  d r o u g h t s  a n d  f i r e  i n  s o m e  a r e a s ,  f l o o d  i n  
other.  
3. Increased likelihood of extreme events --- such as floods, hurricanes, etc. 
4. Melting of the ice caps  --- loss of habitat near the poles. Polar bears are now 
thought to be greatly endangered by th e shortening of their feeding season 
due to dwindling ice packs.  
5. Melting glaciers  - significant melting of old glaciers is already observed. 
6. Widespread vanishing of animal po pulations --- following widespread 
habitat loss. 
7. Spread of disease --- migration of diseases such as malaria to new, now 
warmer, regions. 
8. Bleaching of coral reefs due to warmi ng seas and acidification due to 
carbonic acid formation  --- One third  of coral reefs now appear to have been 
severely damaged by warming seas. 
9. Loss of Plankton due to warming seas --- The enormous (900 miles long) 
Aleution island’s  ecosystem  of orcas (killer whales), sea lions, sea otters, sea 
urchins, kelp beds, and fish population s, appears to have collapsed due to 
loss of plankton, sea lions, orcas  eating too many sea otters, urchin 
explosions, loss of kelp beds and their associated fish population.  
It has been found that though number of books on ‘Global Warming’ is available, but 
no elaborate and in depth research papers are documented to alarm the situation, 
impact on climate changes and its remedial measures. In this book, the subject matter 
has been presented in a very systematic an d logical manner which will satisfy all class 
of readers and research scholars for the de velopment of an eco-friendly society.           P r e f a c e  X I

1. Introduction 
Irrespective of the current so cial and economic problems, th e fact is that hurricane-force 
winds hover over our current way of life, an d ultimately over our very civilization. 
Progressive deforestation, water shortages, loss of biodiversity, the scarcity of natural 
resources exposed to their own ecological limits. The result of all of this is the relentless 
generation of waste, emissions and discharge s into an increasingly limited absorptive 
capacity of the planet. 
The economic debt, in any form, whether it is consumer-related, national or foreign, which 
we hear about every day on the news, is insign ificant compared to the ecological debt we 
are acquiring. In 1997 a study by  the team of Robert Costanza,  specialist in environmental 
economics, estimated the average value of the gl obal ecosystem services to be around the 33 
billion dollars annually. That same year the global GDP was only 18 billion. For example, 
the Global Footprint Network (GFN) calculatio ns of April 2011 showed that Spain entered 
an “ecological debt” situation, having consumed  b y  t h a t  t i m e  t h e  t o t a l  a n n u a l  b u d g e t  i n  
terms of natural resources. 
It is possible to adapt an economic model, to fix it, and replace it, but trying to expand the 
planet is simply utopian. Like it or not, our planet is finite and a finite system is incompatible 
with a subsystem (economic) whose paradigm is  based on continuous and unlimited growth. 
Somehow we have to reconcile growth and sust ainability, and to do so, our companies need 
to access transparent and comparab le information to be able to make the best decisions so as 
not to compromise either their growth or  the impact on the planetary ecosystem. 
Obviously, growth and better living conditions  have to reach develop ing countries where 
per capita income is less than a dollar a month, but it doesn´t seem consistent to raise  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 4 
growth based on production patterns that are supported by 'dirty' technologies in 
developed countries. Identifying sinks in a crit ical absorption situatio n and ecosystems with 
a falling supply in natural resources, on which we base our economy, are critical to our 
survival.  
One of the most critical impacts identified du ring the last century was the likely failure of 
the absorption capacity of our atmosphere to operate as a sink for so-called greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) without producing drastic change s in climatic conditions. These gases are 
named for their characteristic ability to pass short wavelength radiation from the sun and 
retain heat from the earth in the form of long wavelength radiation, which leads to the 
greenhouse effect.  
Reports issued by the Intergov ernmental Panel on Climate Ch ange (IPCC), which includes 
the largest community of experts, are warning us that, like everything in life, a little bit of 
everything is good but too much of one thing can be lethal. 
One of the main problems is the extraordin arily high rate of GHG emissions which our 
society has been generating for more than 100 years. This inhibits any reaction from the 
flora and fauna as well as the human race , which is encountering an increasingly 
unpredictable system from a climatic poin t of view. The planet will absorb these 
greenhouse gases without any problem, but the species that inhabit it will have enormous 
difficulties in adapting to new conditions. The scenario painted by the experts could not be 
more daunting, and urgent warnings for action  m u s t  b e  s e n t  o u t  t o  t h e  g e n e r a l  p u b l i c ,  
businesses and individuals.   
In answer to this impending scenario, Carbonfeel  has been designed with a core mission: to 
organize information and knowledge on the carb on footprint, making it universally useful 
and accessible to all society. In short, the point is to pr ovide companies with the best 
available techniques for calculation and exchan ge of information within the processes of 
inventory, management, reduction and offsetti ng of GHG emissions generated by their own 
activities. 
This information will allow companies to partic ipate actively in improving their behavior, 
without having any effect on their business. Qu ite the contrary; their activities will start to 
focus on production patterns based on eco-effici ency and eco-design, and therefore lead to a 
reduction in costs. Moreover, customers will recognize a continuous improvement effort 
based on a credible label supported by many different certifiers, consultants, companies, 
associations, universities and others. 
The message is very clear to society. Various or ganizations have joined together to facilitate 
the expansion of a responsible economy to help businesses generate goods and services in a 
friendly environment, avoiding the wide variety of labels and certificates with a commercial 
purpose only. We understand from Carbonfeel  that making business compatible with and 
respectful of the environment is not an option , rather it is the only valid way for modern 
business. Whether we recognize this or simply look away depends on the conscience of each 
and every individual.   
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 5 
Carbonfeel provides the public and private wo rld a true environmental accounting system 
based on the universal indicator, the carbon f ootprint (CF), a scorecard that will help them 
choose the best practices in their processes an d procure less intensive goods and services, all 
tending towards a low carbon culture. 
2. The Carbonfeel project 
2.1. Why Carbonfeel? The initiative 
Carbonfeel (http://www.carbonfeel.org) is a collaborative initiative promoted by the 
Environmental Forum Foundation (http://www.fo rumambiental.org), the Interdisciplinary 
University Group Carbon Footprint and the te chnology company Atos (http://atos.net). The 
project provides procedural solutions, meth odological and technological processes of 
calculation, verification, certification and labeling of the carbon footprint both at the 
corporate level and in terms of products and services. 
Any organization that has in its principles of corporate social responsibility the fight against 
climate change as a priority, is invited to part icipate within the profile appropriate to their 
interests, either actively collaborating in th e dissemination of calculation and verification 
projects, or simply calculatin g their footprint. Through this network of collaboration we 
have a carbon footprint that is truly accessible, transparent and comparable. 
Carbonfeel starts out from a methodological  b a s i s  p r o p o s e d  b y  t h e  C o m p o u n d  M e t h o d  
based on Financial Accounts (MC3), inherited fr om the ecological footprint concept that has 
been extended worldwide by its creato rs William Rees and Mathis Wackernagel 
(http://www.footprintnetwork.org). The proj ect takes advantage of other emerging 
methodological trends such as GHG Prot ocol, PAS 2050 or ISO 14064 standards and the 
future ISO 14067 and 14069, in order to get an  approximation of the real calculation. 
Supporting an integrated approach, the incorporation of information technologies makes 
Carbonfeel an innovative project that has burs t into the market to completely change the 
focus of the classic studies of life cycle anal ysis, whose drawbacks in cost and study time 
had already been reported by different anal ysts. This also became evident after the 
announcement in January 2012 of the multinat ional company Tesco (a pioneer in carbon 
footprint labeling), which, after five years of ac tivities in projects of calculation, abandoned 
its initial plan to label all their products with their carbon footprint, blaming the fact that "a 
minimum of several months of work" would be necessary to calculate the footprint of each 
product and the lack of collaboration and mo nitoring of suppliers and other retailers. 
The Guardian previously reported that Tesco would take centuries to fulfill his promise, as 
the supermarket adds labels at  speeds of 125 products a year . A Tesco spokesman expressed 
their expectations to new ways of undertakin g the calculations "We are fully committed to 
the carbon footprint and to helping our custom ers make greener choices. No final decision 
has been taken and we are always on the look out to find ways to better communicate the 
carbon footprint of products in a way that informs and enri ches our clients".  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 6 
Other corporations that have undertaken calc ulation at the corporate level express their 
disappointment at not being able to assume scope 3 (the footprint inherited from their 
suppliers) because of the lack of standardi zation and collaboration in the supply chain, 
which makes the inclusion of the suppliers’ footpr ints in this puzzle completely unreliable.   
The great paradox of the Carbonfeel method is that companies get a carbon footprint at the 
corporate level and the life cycle of all products  and services without any restriction on the 
scopes, with the information provided in great detail. Moreover this information is more 
extensive and of a higher quality as it is based on primary data (real footprint of its 
suppliers), and all at a cost and a time fr ame fully accessible to any corporation. 
The telematic assembly technique provides an  e n t i r e  l i f e  c y c l e ,  w h ere each corporation 
analyzes its own emissions (scope 1 and land use) on an autonomous basis for calculating 
the indirect footprint or i nherited from its suppliers by the telematic assembly. 
This report shows step by step how it is possible to have more and better quality 
information to help companies transform th eir patterns of production and consumption 
habits towards a low carbon culture, and all this in a way that is totally accessible to the 
entire business community, from micro-businesses to SMEs and large corporations. 
2.2. Mission and objectives 
The network of actors involved in the initiati ve offers our society a way of working with a 
clearly defined mission and objectives: 
Mission 
x Organize information and knowledge about the carbon footprint, making it universally 
useful and accessible to all society.  
x Promote new patterns of production in orga nizations and a real transformation of 
consumer habits in society, both directed towards a low carbon culture. 
Objectives 
x Standardization of a methodology for the calcul ation of the carbon footprint based on an 
integrated approach (organizat ion and product/service), always in strict compliance with 
the existing international standards in use,  both at the corporate level (ISO 14064, GHG 
Protocol and future ISO 14069) and prod uct level (PAS 2050 and future ISO 14067). 
x Standardization and automation of the verifi cation and certification processes of the 
carbon footprint. 
x Make available to the general public an a ccesible, transparent an d comparable labeling 
process of the carbon footprint. 
x Incorporation of all the above points in th e information society through the use of the 
new technologies required in the initiative. 
As mentioned previously, countless labels and certifications are saturating the market. Some 
of these are based on calculation methods that have been accommodated to certain interests  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 7 
of the contracting company, a fact which only  s e r v e s  t o  u n d e r m i n e  t h e  c r e d i b i l i t y  o f  t h e  
different studies. This type of dynamics is being used by companies interested in 
'greenwashing' their products and actions. This sometimes leads to an unfair scenario in 
which companies that are truly committed to  t h e  e n v i r o n m e n t a l  i m provement of their 
products are put in a situation where their clie nts can not appreciate the goodness of their 
acts. 
Carbonfeel emerged as a proposal that incorporates a common language based on 
consensus to the vast network of actors involved in the calculation of the carbon footprint. It 
is based on information technologies which allow data exchange to flow quickly and 
reliably, providing accounting and labelin g processes that are renewed annually. 
Carbonfeel seeks the incorporation of all types of businesses into the process of calculation 
and certification. It is no longer a marketing tool only affordable to large corporations, but 
has become a basic environmental accounting tool for the future assessment and analysis of 
improvement actions. Thus, even the smallest company will be eligible for certification. 
Moreover transparency is ensured under the ru les and calculation methods accepted by all, 
without any problems related to subjectivities or cut-off criteria in the delimitation of the 
calculation, and thereby obtaining compar ability as a source of competitiveness. 
The reasons why a project like Carbonfeel has arisen and keeps on growing daily, fall under 
four different perspectives: social, economic, environmental and institutional. 
x Social perspective : introducing concepts such as the carbon footprint and eco-labeling, 
which today are still unknown (in 2010, only 23% of Spanish consumers, compared to 
94% of British or 97% of Japanese, had hear d about the carbon footprint, according to 
studies conducted by TNS). 
x Economic outlook : making it easier for companies th at actually opt for an alternative 
"green" production style so that they ca n have a favorable commercial scenario and, 
thereby, facilitating their growth. 
x Environmental perspective : promoting a real change in production patterns in 
organizations and a real transformation of  c o n s u m e r  h a b i t s  t o w a r d s  a  l o w  c a r b o n  
culture. 
x Institutional perspective : providing consensual solutions that may allow the 
homogenization of the many initiatives of in stitutions at national, regional and even 
local levels, who want to inventory, moni tor and promote attitudes and sustainable 
practises in businesses and citizens. 
2.3. Holding the roof 
If we ask ourselves what kind of results a ca rbon accounting method should provide, the 
most appropriate answer is to help reduce  emissions of greenhouse gases. Any other 
purpose would seem banal. Isn’t the carbon accounting technique supposed to combat 
climate change? Because if the idea is to use it as a tool for promoting green products and 
the corporate image, then there are better ma rketing tools without having to pervert a 
method that was created for a very clear purpose.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 8 
Therefore, disregarding other objectives relate d to the current economic situation, we must 
pay attention to an overview of the results in the attempt to find a working method for 
calculation, verification and labeling which will be truly useful in the fight against global 
climate change. Indeed, there is nothing more useful for companies than to provide 
information that facilitates the reduction of emissions in relative terms (per unit of 
production of a product or serv ice, and emissive intensity), but also in absolute terms (for 
the whole corporation). It’s of little use if we lower emissions relatively while, on the other 
hand, corporate emissions grow due to other ac tions that are not within the scope of the 
current study. 
The roof 
Imagine that what we want to do is build a house with a roof called "to lower emissions" 
and the aim is that the roof shou ld be as large as possible, so that the larger the size of the 
roof, the greater our success in fighting climate change. 
But we cannot put a roof over nothing; we n eed a structure that supports it. What are the 
requirements, given that the greater the support , the greater the roof "to lower emissions” 
will be? 
The beams 
To lower carbon emissions there are few roads to choose from. A simple but subtly 
devastating vision of the problem indicate s that we can do basically three things: 
x Change our patterns of production, either by identifying proces ses for improvement, 
identifying good product design that is more  environmentally friendly in the vector of 
climate change. 
x Identify measures of eco-efficiency in th e consumption of energy and materials in our 
business and production processes. 
x Change our habits, both from the standpoi nt of providing information to the final 
consumer (B2C) of our products and se rvices, and to provide ourselves with 
information from our network of suppliers (B2B) in order to help us to inherit the 
smallest footprint possible of products and services that feed our production system. 
These are the three basic and essential beams re quired to sustain our roof, and if they are 
well-managed they will allow us to reduce emissions from our corporate activities. 
Note that all three require the processing of data quickly and reliably. Let’s explore this 
point that will lead us to the following levels of support for our house. 
The columns 
How can we change our production and consumption patterns, and at the same time 
identify eco-efficient measures in our activities to help  us cut emissions?  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 9 
There is a clear answer to this  question ... we must have reliable and quality data, and this 
information must have three properties that ensure the stability of our house: 
x Accessibility 
x Transparency 
x Comparability 
Let’s consider each of these three points together because all three are intimately 
intertwined. 
We refer to accessibility  as the option for all businesses, from the smallest company to the 
large corporations, to make a claim for a carb on footprint certificate for their products, 
according to the prices and time frames of the projects adapted to the size of the contracting 
company, without omitting, in any case, the other two pillars: transparency and 
comparability. The incorporation process of calc ulating all the business is necessary; a global 
problem requires the involvement of all. 
At present, the size of projects based on calc ulation techniques using the classic life cycle 
analysis, in which a link in the chain (the co mpany who wants to calculate the footprint of 
its product) bears the burden of the whole calculation effort by drawing up complete 
process maps for the product and its life cycle.  However, owing to the sheer size of these 
projects, both financially and operationally, they  cannot be assumed by the majority of small 
and medium-sized enterprises. 
Negotiating the scope of the studies, a common practice adopted by many companies to 
reduce costs, isn’t the solution because it pr events reliable management and threatens the 
basic column of the home we propose to build: the comparability  of results. 
Therefore, the method needs to be accessible to all companies so  that they will have a chance 
to show their carbon intensity, and thus, to improve themselves using benchmarking 
techniques supported by the comparability of results. 
 
Figure 1.  Requirements for a useful carbon accounting method in the fight against climate change 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 10 
The existence of a spreadsheet calculation scheme that ensures the same scope for any 
project provides credibility and confidence to  companies who want to 'play' on a scenario 
with identical rules and conditions. Thus, each company will be sure that their calculations 
have been carried out in the same way as their competitors. 
This assumption is necessary to obtain an exemplary and transparent certificate, and the 
only way to do this is by a reporting method in line with a clear and objective scheme of 
calculation. How many times have we read about the total emission compensation for a 
given organization, where it is impossible to compare the study limits, calculation schemes 
and data sources that underlie the study? 
Indeed, many of them are just "green-washi ng" strategies that confuse consumers and 
prolong a scene truly unfair to companies that  are committed to an environmental strategy 
for its activities. 
Transparency will provide confiden ce to all stakeholders and will eliminate from the carbon 
footprint market opportunistic corporations wi th marketing labels that try to displace 
corporations that are truly committed to sust ainability and fighting climate change. Under 
these conditions of non-tran sparency, the proposed house will have little chance of 
supporting the roof that today’s world demands of us. 
Finally we will describe below the column that will provide definitive support to the 
structure. 
Comparability is one of the most wanted features in a carbon footprint labeling process. It is 
essential to boost competitiveness in favo r of corporate environmental improvement. 
Without comparability, the carbon footprint has no meaning and becomes just another 
environmental label.  
A green purchasing policy, public or private,  m e a n s  i n c l u d i n g  t h e  c a r b o n  f o o t p r i n t  a s  a  
standard for the environmenta l certification of products and services. The lack of 
comparability is one of the main excuses given by certain business sectors not to accept or 
promote green purchasing po licies based on the concept of the carbon footprint. 
Corporations seeking solutions that may allow them to flood the market with products and 
services with a lower carbon load need to identify improvements. Without comparable 
references in the market, these companies ca nnot carry out their mission; they cannot buy 
less carbon intensive goods in the market. 
The foundation 
These columns, representing  accessible, tran sparent and comparable information, require a 
foundation to support them. This is wh at gives strength to the structure: 
x Data consistency 
x Data quality 
To understand what consistency means in this context, it is necessary to explain the great 
paradox of the carbon footprint, which, in  the words of Juan Luis Doménech, chief  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 11 
ideologue of the MC3 methodology, clearly shows how inefficient it is to maintain separate 
approaches to the corporation and products. 
 
Figure 2.  Classification of activities subject to emission rights (scope 1 and 2 are adopted) 
"The methods of the classic life cycle analysis  or methods focused on processes (ACV-P, PAS 
2050) are not easy to implement as they requir e the participation of several companies on 
the value chain. Data acquisition based on the "most relevant processes" varies according to 
the analyst, and the "cutoff criteria" (as th e value chain could be infinite) seriously 
compromise the comparability between products. 
On the other hand, methods focused on th e organization (such as ISO 14064 and GHG 
Protocol) are partial; they allow emissions call ed "scope 3" (materials, services, contracts, 
travel, construction, waste, etc.) to be volu ntary and may vary from company to company. 
This also undermines comparability, at least for now, unless future editions correct this 
situation. On top of this, they are free to choose the calculation method of the actual 
carbon footprint and the emission factors. Th e latter should only come from reliable 
sources." 
Carbonfeel is committed to an integrated appr oach, in which, as in any cost accounting 
method, partial studies are abandoned and a glob al vision of the company as a GHG emitter 
is undertaken in order to enter the gases emi tted into the company’s accountability in all the 
products and serv ices generated. 
This is the consistency which we are referring  to. In the economic sphere, any accountant 
generally applies an integrated approach. An y other alternative with a partial character 
would not be accepted by a financial department. The corporate carbon footprint and the 
footprint of products and services that have no consistency will never be able to offer a 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 12 
scenario based on comparability, and therefore we will be seriously damaging a 
fundamental column of our building. 
Finally, there is a basic foundation that suppo rts the entire building: the quality of the 
survey data. To address this po int, we must first distinguish the subtle difference between 
primary data and secondary data. 
Primary data are obtained from a source thro ugh direct measurements , or provided by the 
same supplier that certifies that measurement to us in the case of an inherited footprint. In 
some ways it is a fact that closely re flects the local situation under study. 
When primary data are not access ible due to the high cost in obtaining this information or 
simply because the provider does not provide it , we turn to what is called secondary data, 
provided by reliable sources. Conversion factor s, databases or simulation tools give us a 
valid approximation to the data. 
Logically, it is desirable that the calculations  are supported by primary data to have a better 
approach to the real data. However, in the current  state of the art, this is not true, and there 
is a lucrative business to be had in providin g companies with secondary data to support 
their calculations. 
Somehow these secondary sources, which are needed  in the current state of the art, indicate, 
for example, that 100 gr. of sugar has a given carbon footprint load based on a life cycle 
study carried out under certain conditions. This figure is only a simplification that causes 
almost all companies to end up giving the same results for their studies due to the fact that 
all of them are based on the same referenc e data, rather than relying on the myriad  
scenarios that make up the current sugar production situation. It is not the same to have a 
local supplier, in this sugar production pr ocess case, than one that is 10,000 km away. 
Thus, when discussing data qualit y, we refer to the fact that the proposed working method 
should be oriented towards the development and distribution of raw data (actual data 
derived from measurements provided by the su pplier), and not to the business of secondary 
data. The role of secondary data in a calculation methodology is necessary, but as an 
alternative, not as an end. 
2.4. State of the art 
Before getting into the working method of Carbonfeel, we must make some comments on 
the state of the art which will help provide so me insight into the advantages offered by the 
proposed method.  
In a study commissioned by the European Comm ission in 2010, a total of 80 corporate CF 
calculation methodologies were identified, and 62 in the approach to products or services, 
each with countless variations and sectorial "sensitivities".  
It could be said that once the calculation has been made, even within the same methodology, 
the results can be quite different depending on the analyst conduc ting the study, the 
collaboration of the chain and data sources used.   
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 13 
Obviously, there are a wide variety of reas ons why companies choose to use a corporate 
approach or a product approach. Corporate carb on footprint studies are mainly undertaken 
when the company’s activity is subject to emi ssion permits and therefore it is mandatory to 
do so. In addition to this, a company may undertake these studies to communicate a green 
image to third parties and finally, these studie s are undertaken to identify possible sources 
of inefficiencies that result in co st savings in energy and resources.  
In the product approach, interests have nothin g to do with the emission permits, but lie 
closer to the promotion of products by associ ating them with a green image, to meet the 
requirements of international customers, and even to identify impr ovements in the eco-
efficiency of the production process and the us e and disposal of the products and services 
under study.  
As shown, they are all partial interests. If a company undertakes annual corporate carbon 
footprint studies in order to contribute to the fight against climat e change, these partial 
interests will automatically be fullfilled as they will have a real environmental accounting 
method with relevant information to mana ge and communicate as they see fit.   
Carbonfeel proposes a method that gets more and better information at a lower cost, which 
favors the annual monitoring of this type of  accounting, as in the field of economics.  
We cannot imagine a company doing accounting pr ocesses only every two or three years, so 
why is it acceptable in the environmental field?  
 
Figure 3.  What does the state of art tell us? 
The answer is obvious, because there are no ava ilable data to avoid the great effort in terms 
of time and economics that a company must ex ert if it wants to undertake this type of 
environmental accounting.  
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 14 
While we have outlined the difficulties of conducting studies with partial approaches 
(corporate vs product/service level), let us do a brief inventory of the current situation and 
its impact on the construction of this buil ding whose roof we call “emission cuts". 
The calculation process at a corporate level faces the following obstacles:  
x Great difficulty reaching scope 3. Collectin g the supplier’s indirect footprint is an 
impossible mission for many corporations. In  a d d i t i o n  t o  t h e  p r o c e d u r a l  d i f f i c u l t y  
involved in "forcing" providers to do the calculation, it is based on a totally non-
standard assembly process in which each pr ovider chooses the method to calculate the 
footprint of their products. This creates great distortion and the results lack credibility.  
x Voluntary choice of the calculation method, and the scope and the emission factors as 
long as they come from 'reliable source s'. This leaves the spreadsheet open.  
x Inconsistency with the footprint of products  or services when these are calculated.  
x Legislation compliance (CO 2 e m i s s i o n  r i g h t s )  r a t h e r  t h a n  s e a r c h i n g  f o r  s c e n a r i o s  o f  
competitiveness among enterprises. 
x Risk of outsourcing scope 3. In deed, if it is decided not to calculate the footprint, then 
all that is needed is to outsource the activiti es (eg. transportation) so as not to include 
the footprint in the studies as they  are not part of scopes 1 and 2.  
x Risk of dispersion of the network.  This is perhaps the most serious drawback. The 
corporate carbon footprint, despite all the potential it has to do a complete analysis 
of the corporation’s resour ce consumption, may become a mere bureaucratic 
procedure.  
x It is not possible to compare emission intensity. The basic indicator that informs us 
about CO 2 emissions per monetary income of a corporation is disabled by not including 
all ranges in the calculation studies.  
Regarding the approach to products based on a life cycle analysis, the following are 
identified:  
x Great difficulty in project development since the participation of many companies is 
required. Projects become a repetitive search for information within a company 
network usually with little willingness to cooperate, either because they are not 
interested, or because it is hard work getting the required information. This causes 
unaffordable time and costs for many corporations.  
x Accessibility based on the negotiation of the scope of studies. As it is virtually 
impossible to face the whole cycle with all it s ramifications, the cutoff criteria may be 
capable of being negotiated subjectively, simply according to economic criteria.  
x It calculates potential impacts, not real impacts. By eliminating corporate carbon 
accounting, LCA studies face process maps wi th theoretical material, according to data 
provided by companies on in puts and outputs, data which are based on patterns of 
behavior often very far from the business reality under study.  
x Risk of “tailor made” labeling. One of the biggest risks is the profusion of non-
transparent product labeling, based on studie s whose sole purpose is to bring carbon 
footprint labeled products to the market but with hardly any verifiable indications.   
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 15 
x No application criteria of secondary sources.  The method is mostly based on secondary 
data support, on which there is no consensus either locally based or  sectorial, causing 
distortion in the calculations and avoiding possible scenarios for comparison.  
x High subjectivity of the analyst and the contracting firm on the calculation 
specifications.  
x Comparability is ruled out due to problems arising from the above points. 
Comparability can not be assumed.  
x Indirect carbon charges are dismissed. Stud ies based on process maps rule out carbon 
loads from 'non relevant' processes for the corporate character. The relevance or non 
relevance of these processes is not regulated or is difficult to verify. 
x Focused on the business of secondary data. In order to rule out the primary character of 
the data due problems with availability, secondary data bases, which are hard to 
upgrade, are promoted. These data provide estimations, but in no case can they 
calculate a carbon load close to the real business performance.  
x Inconsistency of product-level calculations from the corporate perspective. Life cycle 
assessments lose business perspectives. They focus on the product in search of patterns 
of behavior, leaving aside the real carbon lo ads of the corporations which belong to the 
chain under study.   
2.5. The integrated approach: The key question 
Once the open points of the approaches are detected, we shall see in this section the 
calculation of both the corporate and produc ts/services footprint. The method not only 
closes many of these points, but reinforces consistency, transparency and finally ensures 
the comparability of results opening up a spectrum of possibilities for action in the 
business world to encourage changes in production patterns, eco-efficiency and 
consumption habits.  
Paradoxically, a calculation based on an integr ated approach is both more economical and 
more complete. It includes all ranges. The company stops worrying about the tracking of 
emissions that are out of view (scope 3 in th e approach to corporate and upstream approach 
to product based on LCAs) and focuses exclusiv ely on the part of their responsibility, the 
direct emissions and the organization’s land use. Therefore, time of calculation is drastically 
reduced, making it assumable to all the business.  
There is no doubt that if a corporation is seri ously facing a study of carbon footprint with 
high quality information in order to improve emissions intensity of their activities (Kg of 
CO 2 emitted by € of income), an integrated approach has to be undertaken.  
If we talk about accounting, there is no ge neral manager that takes more seriously into 
consideration the importance of data quality and consistency than a CFO. This CFO, when 
performing cost accounting, never conducts an 'upstream' research on costs which has 
impacted the income statement of its products in  the life cycle. Obviously it is impossible to 
assume such studies because no longer are th ey economically sustainable and results are 
useless due to the uncertainty that they ca use. He simply counts the costs of the  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 16 
organization and then splits them between the ac tual production, which gives a true picture 
of the corporate cost accounting of each of their products and services.  
So, why does a Director of Environment face AC Vs projects with a high level of economic 
demand for accounting the carbon footprint of its products, when it only provides potential 
emission values as it misses the whole business perspective? We can list many reasons, but, 
from the technical point of view, we would say that it is impossible to assess the actual cost 
or carbon footprint per functional unit of  e a c h  g o o d  o r  s e r v i c e  p u r c h a s e d  b y  t h e  
organization. This is the key difference be tween why a CFO carries out an integrated 
accounting and why a Director of Environment cannot perform it. 
But, if this should be solved, if somehow someone had a method that moved all purchases, 
usually in monetary value, to carbon footprint, the problem would be solved, at least in part.  
 
Figure 4.  The integrated approach 
2.6. The Compound method based on Financial Accounts (MC3) 
The Compound Method based on Financial Acco unts (MC3) has two different uses. Firstly, 
the MC3 provides an inventory of material s, goods, services and generated wastes 
transformed into a common unit, EqtCO 2. This information is useful to elaborate 
environmental policies and corrective measures based on the CF at an organizational level. 
Secondly, the footprint of a company can be assi gned to the produced goods. In this case, 
the organizational footprints assess the produc t’s CF across the supply chain, identifying the 
 
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 17 
footprint at every phase of the life cycle. The distribution of the footprint of every 
organization among the produced goods requir es unitary footprints expressed in Gha/t 
and/or tCO 2/t. When a firm purchases a good, th e acquiring company will use unitary 
footprints to estimate his organizational footprint. 
Organisation level 
The MC3 was developed by Doménech [1,2]. Initially the method assessed the CF of 
companies and organizations. Nowadays, the method also estimates the CF of goods and 
services throughout the supply chain. 
In both cases, the starting point of the MC3 is the estimation of the CF of organizations. This 
chapter briefly describes the method at this level. A more detailed explanation can be found 
in [1-4]. 
The origin of MC3 can be found in the concept of  household footprint [5]. In this way, based 
on the matrix of consumptions versus land pr esent in the spreadsheet for the calculation of 
households’ footprint [5], Doménech [1] prep ares a similar consumption land-use matrix 
(CLUM) (see table 2), which contains the consum ptions of the main categories of products 
needed by a company. The land-use matrix also includes sections for the wastes generated 
and the use of land. These consumptions/waste s will be transformed into land units and 
greenhouse emissions [6]. Carbonfeel initiative  has improved this CLUM matrix, including 
new categories of products, emissions and conversion factors (MC3.V.2). 
The needed information to estimate CF using MC3 is mainly obtained from accounting 
documents such as the balance sheet and the income statement, which clearly state the 
activities that are associated with every enti ty: MC3 estimates the footprint of all the goods 
and services considering information from financial accounts. Wastes generated and built-
up surface by all the facilities of the compan y are also included. Further information from 
other company departments with specific data about certain sections (waste generation, use 
of land by the organization’s facilities, among others) may also be necessary in case this 
information is excluded from the financial accounts. The footprint is calculated in a 
spreadsheet, which also work s as the CLUM matrix.  
The rows of this CLUM matrix show the foot print of each category of product/service 
consumed. The columns present, among other el ements, different land-use categories for 
CF, into which the footprint is divided. Column s are divided into five groups. The first one 
(see column 1) corresponds to the description of the different categories of consumable 
products. These are classified into 9 major cate gories showed in Table 1. One can include as 
many products as desired within each category.  
The second group (columns 2–6) shows each pr oduct’s consumption, expressed in specific 
units. The units in the first column of the grou p are related to product’ s characteristics (e.g., 
electricity consumption, in kWh). The se cond column indicates the value of the 
consumptions in monetary units, while the th ird shows consumptions in tonnes. The fifth 
column reveals energy corresponding to each consumption expressed in gigajoules (GJ),  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 18 
obtained by multiplying tonnes of product (thi rd column) by the quanti ty of energy used by 
tonne in its production (G J/t) (fourth column) [7].

Energy intensity factors comprise the amount of energy used in the production of every 
product included in the CLUM matrix, cons idering an average supply chain. At this 
moment, they are mainly obtained from th e European Commission [8-10], Simmons [11], 
Wackernagel [5,12] and different public instit utions such as Spanish Office for Climate 
Change (OECC) and The Institute for Ener gy Diversification and Saving (IDAE) and 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  I P C C  [ 1 3 ] .  T h e  t h i r d  g r o u p  o f  c o l u m n s   
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 19 
(columns 7 and 8) show emission factors for ev ery category of product. Emission factors are 
mainly obtained from the European Commissi on [8-10,14,15], IPCC [13], OECC and IDAE.  
The fourth group contains six columns (9–14) showing the distribution of the footprint 
among different categories of land. These are the same as that used for the countries’ 
ecological footprint (CO 2 absorption, cropland, pastures, fo rests, built-up land, and fishing 
grounds). 
Finally, MC3 estimates the organizations’ counte r footprint. The counter footprint concept 
starts from the positive regard for the companies’ availability of natural capital, despite the 
desirable reduction of their footprint by bein g more efficient and by curbing consumption. 
Therefore, investments in this ki nd of productive space reduce their footprint. In this way, 
this indicator could encourage the private se ctor’s involvement in the preservation of 
natural spaces [2], as which is positive in terms of sustainability [6].  
Product level 
Since the year 2005 a team of researchers from  t h e  U n i v e r s i t i e s  o f  O v i e d o ,  C a n t a b r i a ,  
Valencia, Cádiz, Santiago de Compostela and La Coruña, coordinated by Juan Luís 
Domenech, have been developing MC3 at an organisation level. A member of this group, 
Adolfo Carballo-Penela, of the University of  Santiago de Compostela, has broadened the 
scope of the method to products, and has deve loped the theoretical and practical knowledge 
needed to determine how they should be ecolabelled [3]. 
Information from products considering supply ch ains is useful for both, companies and final 
consumers. Companies can reorganize their ex isting processes, obtaining environmental 
improvements and reductions of costs. Ecolabelling processes based on CF allow 
consumer’s purchase decisions to have a positive influence in achieving a more sustainable 
world. 
From the MC3’s perspective, CF throughout th e life of a good or service considers those 
land and emissions required/gener ated by each of the companies involved in its production, 
from the phase of raw materials up to the retail point. Every company itself is a phase of the 
supply chain. 
Figure 5 shows an example of this way of pr oceeding. In this case, the supply chain is 
composed by four companies which produc e canned tuna fish: a fishing company, a 
preserves company, a carrier and a restaurant. If  the customer of the restaurant applies for 
lower CF products, the restaurant must reduce  it s footpr int to meet th is demand. Act ions 
like reducing consumption of goods and waste generation, recycling activities, or 
technologies that are more efficient would be effective in this case. The purchase of goods 
with a lower footprint is also a valid option , replacing present suppliers for other lower-
footprint providers. Asking pr esent suppliers to reduce thei r CF and, therefore, their 
product’s footprint is a possible recommendation as well. The demand for lower footprint 
products can be extended to all the participan ts of the considered lifecycle and to all the 
goods of the economy.

A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 21 
The adoption of MC3’s supply chain approach re quires establishing links among the CF of 
the different companies of the supply chain. When each of the participants in the lifecycle of 
a product acquires different goods from the co mpany situated in the previous phase, they 
are also acquiring the CF incorporated in th at good. If every participant communicates the 
unitary footprints of the goods and services that  produces (e.g. eqtCO2/t of product) to the 
following phase of the supply chain, the needed  connection is made. Footprints per tonne of 
product (unitary footprints) are obtained divi ding the total footprint of every company by 
its production. Table 3 collects an ex ample of this way of proceeding. 
This case is similar to that shown in Figure 5. In this case, a retailer replaces the carrier. This 
example assumes that each participating compan y produces only one tonne of one product, 
the canned tuna fish, which is purchased by  t h e  n e x t  c o m p a n y  i n  t h e  s u p p l y .  E v e r y  
company also acquires 1 ton of the rest of the used products. Information of the CF is shown 
in Table 3.

Table 3.  An example of unitary footprints applicat ion in the lifecycle of canned tuna fish 
The fishing company would estimate its foot print using the unitary footprints of the 
acquired goods, in this example, fuels (2.0 EqtCO 2/t of product) and bait fish (6.0 EqtCO 2/t of 
product). Considering these values, the CF of on e tonne of tuna fish at this phase of the 
supply chain is 8.0 EqtCO 2/t of product. The preserves company acquires a tonne of tuna 
fish, which means, 8.0 EqtCO 2/t of product. This company adds footprint from the 
consumption of one ton of machinery (7.0 EqtCO 2/t of product), being its total footprint of 
15.0 EqtCO 2/t of product, the only commercialized  product of the preserves company.  
In this example, the retailer’s purc hase of fuel generates 2.5 EqtCO 2/t of product. In addition, 
this firm acquires 1 tonne of tuna fish (15 EqtCO 2/t of product) from the preserves company.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 22 
This means a total footprint of 17.5 EqtCO 2/t of product of tuna fish, sold to the restaurant. 
This company also adds 3.5 EqtCO 2/t of product , from the electricity used in its activities, 
which implies a CF of 21.0 EqtCO 2/t of product of tuna fish at the end of the supply chain. 
This value would be showed in an ecolabel that  collects the CF of this preserved fish tuna. 
We want to remark that the total footprint of th e tuna fish is not estimated as the sum of the 
footprint of all the companies involv ed in the supply chain (61.5 EqtCO 2/t of product). By 
doing this, the footprint of tuna is multiple-c ounted since every compan y includes the fish’s 
footprint of the previous phase. The tuna fi sh’s CF is estimated considering the added 
footprint in every stage of the supply chain. 
Starting of the method 
The use of MC3 to estimate the CF of products  needs of unitary footprints for each of the 
categories of products collected in the CLUM  matrix. These unitary footprints come from 
secondary data from pilot studies. The pilot studies are based on the energy intensities and 
emission factors usually used by the MC3, besides results from other supply chain studies 
that estimate the emissions from primary data. 
The transmission of CF across the supply chain an d its use as an ecolabel will depend on the 
will of the participants in the supply chain to  estimate their footprint. The success of the 
adopted approach depends on the organizations’ awareness of the advantages of estimating 
the footprint of their products . Environmental marketing differe ntiation and savings related 
to a more efficient use of materials and ener gy along the supply chain are relevant questions 
that should be considered [16]. However, Carbonfeel initiative will provide involved 
companies with enough information to estimate the footprint of the pr oducts they purchase. 
The support of national or regional governments seems to encourage companies’ 
participation in countries like the United Kingdom, where DEFRA and the Carbon Trust 
have developed a key role to accelerate the process. In the absence of public sector 
participation, interested companies should en courage customers and providers to estimate 
their CF and communicate them along the supply chain.

Boundaries of the analysis 
MC3 is based on the cradle-to-gate life cycles . This means that MC3 assesses CF from the 
raw materials phase to the retailing phase, by in cluding all the activities required to extract 
the raw materials for the product, manufactur e the product, and ship the product to the 
point of purchase. MC3 does not consider footpr ints from the use and disposal of goods.  
MC3’s footprints collect the demand of land/emissions of CO 2 of all the goods and services 
acquired by every company, the generated wa stes, and the built-up land in each of the 
phases of the lifecycle. 
Transmission of the information across th e supply chain and ecolabelling process 
In case of goods for final consumption and serv ices, the information about unitary footprints 
(tCO 2/t) should be incorporated in the common pr ice labels, tickets and similar documents. 
Invoices, delivery notes, contracts, budgets or any other documents containing prices should 
add CF information at the intermediate phases of  the lifecycle. This is the way that the CF 
information is available during the entire life cycle and transmitted. Once Carbonfeel begins 
to work, information technologies will simplify the process of communicating footprints 
among companies. 
When a company acquires a product, the purc hase documents should include the unitary 
footprint accumulated until that moment and making possible to use that information for 
estimating its organizational footprint. If a supplier does not provide information on a 
product, Carbonfeel database will supply this  i n f o r m a t i o n .  T h i s  d a t a b a s e  i n c l u d e s  t h e  
unitary footprints on standard lifecycles for th e main categories of products included in the 
CLUM matrix. They are obtained from pilo t studies. These unitary footprints show 
information from the different st ages of the supply chain. Considering the case of the tuna 
fish (Table 3) different unitary footprints for “Tuna fish”, “Preserved tuna fish”, “Preserved 
tuna fish: retailer” and Preser ved tuna fish: restaurant” should be available for the MC3 
users. At this moment, the Carbonfeel databa se is under development. Obtaining detailed 
information about more goods and services requires an increase in the number of pilot 
studies.  
Assessment of the exposed method 
Similar to the other methodological appr oaches, the MC3 has some strengths and 
limitations, summarized in the following sections. 
In previous articles, authors have stated that the MC3 is a complete, transparent and 
technically feasible method based on Wacke rnagel and Rees comp ound method. Working 
with MC3 does not require extensive expert  s t a f f  i n p u t s  a n d  e v e r y b o d y  w o r k i n g  w i t h  
spreadsheets will be able to calculate CF. MC3 is also a flexible and complete method. MC3 
can be adapted to the characteristics of differe nt types of companies, collecting the footprint 
from all the products consumed and wastes generated by a company [7].  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 24 
The fact that the information comes from acce ssible financial documents, and that every 
company covers a complete phase of the lifecycle implies lower economic and time costs, 
besides delimiting clearly the products and acti vities that are under analysis. This ensures 
comparability among products. 
The theoretical presentation of the method re quires determining participants in the supply 
chain. In practice, every company gets the environmental information of the purchased 
products from their suppliers or from the Carbonfeel databa se. According to the European 
Commission [17], the market could become a po werful force for delivering environmental 
improvement. The role of markets as the ma in source of environmental information on 
products, thereby absorbing environmental pe rformance as a competitive issue, is an 
important strength of the meth od. The identification between  a corporation and the supply 
chain phase also favours the collection of info rmation, obtained from every company [6]. 
The way of estimating the CF avoids double counting problems with some intermediate 
inputs, a relevant question in this context [ 18,19]. Organisational footprints are useful in 
terms of making decisions on improving envi ronmental performance of organizations but 
never in terms of aggregating environmental impacts. This aggregation is only possible in 
terms of the products. 
This analysis is less detailed than conventi onal process-based life cycle assessment. The 
organization’s activities are not divided into  d e t a i l e d  s i m p l e  p r o c e s s e s  t h a t  s h o w  t h e  
amount of energy, and materials consumed in  e v e r y  s t a g e  o f  t h e  p r o d u c t i o n .  I n s t e a d  o f  
doing this, MC3 includes all the goods, serv ices and wastes consumed/generated for the 
organizations in a period. The use of unitary footprints or energy intensities and other 
aggregated information allow MC3 to estimate CF. 
Benefits of the integrated approach 
Recalling the three basic pillars necessary for a ca rbon accounting method to be useful to the 
company in its fight against clim ate change, we note that an integrated approach, like MC3, 
provides a number of benefits that can solve many of the open issues identified in the 
approaches focused on the organizatio n and on an individual product.  
Transparency  
x All calculations are based on reliable sources of recognized standing and free access.  
x There are neither subjective criteria of the study design limits nor cutoff criteria, since 
the scope is complete.  
x As a result, customers and consumers ar e well aware that the Carbonfeel label 
guarantees studies that have been conducte d on an equal basis in all participating 
organizations. A company facing a Carbonf eel project can communicate this to the 
interested parties, who will accept and trust in these studies.  
x The information is not just potential, it clos ely reflects the true business reality of the 
organization and provides critical indicators  o f  e m i s s i o n  i n t e n s i t y  w h i c h ,  w i t h  t h e  
inclusion of all scopes, provides an idea of  the company’s situation in terms of carbon 
accounting.   
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 25 
Accessibility  
x The information is found within the company; it isn’t necessary to to get it from the 
network of suppliers. The calculation is completely autonomous and does not depend 
on other organizations.  
x As a result, the study times are speeded up exponentially. This process will be 
optimized over time once the elements in volved in automating the calculation, 
exchange and assembly of inform ation have been identified.  
x Moreover, the project cost dr ops dramatically by not requiring mapping processes and 
the subsequent investigation in the whole supply chain.  
Comparability  
x By not having to develop cut off criteria, studies ensure full comparability.  
x In the near future it will be possible to design  carbon footprint labels  type III of sectorial 
goods and services as long as comparability of results is guaranteed.  
Added to these benefits, the integrated approa ch provides a foundation which ensures that 
the three columns will support the building. The consistency of the results, defined as the 
consistency between the Corporate Carbon Foot print and the Carbon Footprint of products 
and services.  
2.7. The pending issue 
Note that an integrated approach can be improved by adding a foundation to provide 
greater stability to the building to be constr ucted, which results in more transparency, 
comparability and accessibility. It is theref ore more likely to transform our patterns of 
production and consumption.  
As mentioned, virtually all methods of calculation are oriented towards the use of 
secondary data when incorporating emission s from the lifecycle or footprint of our 
suppliers. Multiple databases with commercial or free access grow asynchronously, which 
adds a new point of controversy to the calculations, leading to a lack of comparability of the 
results.  
MC3 provides the factors to estimate the carb on footprint based on sources and conversion 
factors that continue to be a secondary database such as, for example, used energy 
intensities.  
We understand that a working method of carbon accounting should be aimed at facilitating 
the integration of primary data, i.e. the actu al footprint of goods or services which are 
acquired or participate in a given life cycle.  
The integrated approach favors this. If so mehow we could operate like a CFO and get the 
cost of what you buy on each bill, i.e. the actu al carbon footprint per functional unit that a 
Director of Environment has to charge to thei r accounts and then multiply it by the real 
consumption, we will be laying a vital foundation:  data quality.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 26 
The 'green coin' can become a reality if we pay attention to the technological factor faced by 
the carbon footprint as a prob lem of information exchange.

2.8. Connecting the network: The role of information technology 
Carbonfeel relies on information technology in or der to provide the benefits of an integrated 
approach, the foundation related to data quality,  i.e. obtaining the real carbon footprint of 
each good or service consumed.  
This solves one of the great challenges of the technical studies related to life cycle analysis, 
which is nothing more than having the ability to 'assemble' the “real” footprint or primary 
data from each of links in the chain involved in the processes of the product life cycle to be 
calculated.  
From the viewpoint of a computer analyst, this  problem, faced from the perspective of the 
information exchange between various pa rtners, requires only two things:  
x Consensus on the semantics of computation 
x Cooperation of the parties 
Carbonfeel has a Committee of technical expe rts familiarized with MC3, input-output 
analysis, life cycle analysis su ch as PAS 2050, and others, which take the best solutions 
provided by each one to achieve an integrated approach. All this work is related to adopting 
some form of calculation. The semantic analyst's job is to compile these agreements into 
electronic dictionaries that provide the rules for computer analysts and databases so they 
can develop software able to calculate the carb on footprint based on these rules, and more 
importantly, to exchange information between different actors.  
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 28 
Assembling the life cycle 
As discussed earlier, the mission of Carbonfeel is to organize information and knowledge 
about the carbon footprint, ma king it universally useful and accessible to all society. 
Translating this purpose to a practical langua ge, we can say that, based on an integrated 
approach and the best available techniques, Carbonfeel determines how to calculate a 
carbon footprint on a neutral level (valid for any type of company), and also how to 
calculate the footprint for a particular sector. Se ctorial standards will be created to be able to 
apply the rules to all economic activities sectors.  
Once these standards, rules and calculation schemes are stablished, always in strict 
compliance with existing IS Os and future ISO 14064, ISO 14067 and ISO 14069, it will be 
possible to develop a software able to calculat e, and what is more important, to exchange 
information between different actors.  
Once the corporate footprint has been calculat ed, the deployment to products and services 
of the corporation is carried out primarily by  m e a n s  o f  t w o  b a s i c  t e c h n i q u e s  w h i c h  a r e ,  
curiously enough, the same techni ques that a CFO normally uses: 
x Distribution of carbon loads directly to th e products and services  according to agreed 
sectorial schemes. This scheme is recommended for small and medium enterprises or 
corporations with little variety of products and services.  
x Distribution of loads on a map of processes and activities. In fact, it is very similar to an 
ABC Costing study, well known in the accounting field. This method is ideal for the 
identification of inefficient processes an d activities and is recommended for large 
corporations with complex process maps.  
In the second case there is a clear connection wi th calculation techniques based on Life Cycle 
Assessment, already introduced into the mark et as PAS 2050 and Product Categories Rules 
PCRs. These may acquire a new dimension in the benefits they provide when focusing on an 
integrated approach. 
With these raw elements, it is possible to co nsider (based on an integrated approach) 
combining the worlds of econ omics and the environment by  i m p l e m e n t i n g  t h e  c a r b o n  
accounting system in exactly the same way that any organization does its financial 
accounting.  
The idea is as simple as it is powerful. Each one of the goods or services purchased must be 
assessed as a debit in the footprint of the br anch company. The produc ts involved, goods or 
services sold generate the cumulative footprin t passed on to the next link in the chain once 
the allocation of corporate footprint of the go ods and services produced by the organization 
has been made.  
Does this Carbonfeel footprint calculation repr esent a product life cycle as promoted by the 
standards of the ISO 14040 series? In fact, it is a life cycle from cradle to the gate, ready to be 
assembled in the following link (customer buying the product or service), but with a 
substantial difference as compared to a classi c project. While in the latter the footprint has  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 29 
been calculated for a single organization (w hich has commissioned the study), with the 
assembly method, every link has estimate d its own part of the whole life cycle, 
independently and based on actual footpr ints of its first level providers.  
The question arises: what if th e suppliers are not in the network of calculation and do not 
provide their footprint? This is the point wher e Carbonfeel resorts to the secondary data to 
come as close as possible to the reality of the study.  
It is important to note that the integrated  C a r b o n f e e l  a p p r o a c h  i s  o r i e n t e d  t o w a r d s  a  
telematics assembly of “real” primary carbon footprint data. The secondary data cease to be 
the only possible data to take on an alternat ive role. The technology exists. Developing the 
semantics and required software is only a matter of time. The benefits are for everyone, in 
both the B2B and B2C environment. The enti re network is benefited thanks to the 
accessibility provided by information technology. Government, businesses and citizens will 
have quality, consistent, transparent, compar able and accessible info rmation. The building 
will have a strength that will help us fi ght climate change with better weapons.  
A Carbonfeel project offers companies a real environmental accounting method based on a 
universal indicator such as the carbon footprin t, which analyzes the corporation and each of 
the products and services generated.

3. Application of MC3 methodolog y and Carbonfeel philosophy in a  
case study: Calculation of the corporate carbon footprint of a  
cement industry in Spain 
The climate change is one of the biggest problems the humanity copes with nowadays. 
Therefore, reducing the CO 2 e m i s s i o n s  o f  s e c t o r s  s u c h  a s  t h e  c e m e n t  i n d u s t r y ,  w h o s e  
emissions account for roughly 5% of the total CO 2 emissions worldwide [20], is a primary 
goal in order to comply with the object ives laid down in the Kyoto protocol. 
Throughout the next pages it will be presented the application of the organization-product-
based-life-cycle assessment (hereafter OP-L CA) methodology (MC3) to three types of 
cement facilities in order to calculate the corporate carbon footprint of the cement 
manufactured in three different ways. 
Our goal is not only to determine the foot print calculated in this way but also to 
demonstrate that the comparability between di fferent brands and products is totally 
possible, thus providing a serious alternative to process-product-based-life-cycle assessment 
(P-LCA) methodologies. Moreover, as a result of  t h e  a n a l y s i s ,  i t  w i l l  b e  a l s o  p o s s i b l e  t o  
identify the best ways forward to achieve the lowest possible footprint. 
As mentioned, this case study was carried out with three potential scenarios in mind: Case 
A pertaining to a conventional integral plan t which we will call “current”, Case B which 
refers to a grinding plant and Case C, an inte gral plant which has been subject to the best 
available techniques (BAT). 
The three scenarios were modeled with the same productivity of 1,000,000 t/year in order to 
simplify the comparability between them. Their di fferences as far as operability is concern 
can be drawn from the next descriptions of each one. 
 
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 31 
Case A – “Current integral plant” 
In general terms, this type of plant includes a line that consists of the following processes:  
After the crude cement has been ground and dr ied, the resulting product is a powder which 
is 80% calcareous, 19% clay and 1% iron corrector. The moisture is roughly 8%.  
Next it goes through the four-step cyclone exch anger. There, heat is transferred from the 
gases to the crude cement; the residual moisture  is dried; the water making up the clay is 
lost; and decarbonation begins.  
After this operation, the crude product is plac ed into the rotating kiln at approximately 
900ºC while the decarbonation, fusion and clinke rization reactions are completed.  The fuel 
used is coke, which raises the temperat ure inside the kiln to nearly 2000ºC.  
The newly formed clinker leaves the kiln at ar ound 1500ºC and is then released onto a grate 
cooler, where it is cooled to 100ºC by mean s of air exchange. The gases from both the 
cyclone exchanger and the kiln are filtered before being released into the atmosphere.  
Finally, the cement is ground along with the additives in a tubular ball mill until a particle 
size of roughly microns is achieved. The produc t is then packaged and stored until it is 
shipped.  
Case B – “Grinding plant” 
This plant receives the clinker from outside so urces, generally imported from China and/or 
Turkey. Therefore, this plant simply grinds the outsourced clinker with the additives and 
ships the cement obtained.  
At the present time, the great majority of the pl ants use closed circuit tubular ball mills with 
a highly efficient turbo-separator which allows th e fineness of the cement to be controlled by 
means of centrifugal force. The dust is removed from the mill and the turboseparador by 
sleeve filters. Since the clinker may contain some moisture, the grinding facility usually 
has a hot gas oven. It does not generally have  a drying chamber. Instead this process is 
carried out in the first grinding chamber.  The final product, the cement, has a particle size 
of around 30 microns. It is transported by means of aerogliders to rubber belt bucket 
elevators and then to the cement stock silos.  F i n a l l y  t h e  p r o d u c t  i s  p a c k a g e d  a n d  s t o r e d  
until it is shipped. 
Since clinker is imported, the plants are forc ed to manufacture cement with the minimum 
percentage of this material, in order to cut co sts. Therefore it is logical to use the maximum 
amount of subproducts as additives. However, we must remember that in Spain 
independent companies do not have access to ma terials like slag from blast furnaces or fly 
ash, which are monopolized by integral cement  factories, which have exclusive agreements 
with the producers of these materials. Therefor e, there are two possible options: either the 
manufacture of cement is carried out with limestone additives and a high content of clinker 
or with the use of materials such as bottom as h which may be classified as natural calcined  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 32 
pozzolana, since Standard EN 197-1 does not currently allow its commercialization as power 
station ash.  
Case C – “BAT integral plant” 
The operating process is the same as case A, but here the factory uses all the technologies 
and principles associated with the concept of  the “Best Available Techniques” of the IPPC, 
at the current level. Below is a description of  t h e  l a t e s t  i n n o v a t i o n s  a s  c o m p a r e d  t o  t h e  
previous reference.  
After the crude product has been ground  a n d  d r i e d ,  t h e  d r y  p o w d e r  u n d e r g o e s  
homogenization, which produces a uniform product that facilita tes even heating. This is 
carried out by means of a controlled flow system of the different layers of material as they 
enter the silo consisting of a mixture of comp ressed air at the exit of the filter, with or 
without a separate chamber. The stock of powder  is the equivalent of around three days of 
kiln time. 
Next the powder enters the cyclone exchanger, this time, during five successive steps, where 
the heat is transferred from the gases to the cr ude cement; the residual moisture is dried; the 
water making up the clay is lost; and decarbonation begins. 
At the base of the exchanger, part of the to tal fuel is injected into the kiln, in the 
precalcination system, with the help of the combustion air supply from the head of the kiln 
through an ad hoc tertiary air duct. Fuel injectio n is carried out in several steps to reduce the 
emission of NOx. 
According to the principle of BAT, the percentage  of total fuel injected into the precalcinator 
is around 70%, with 30% being injected into the head burner (as opposed to 25% and 75% 
respectively in case A). Secondary fuels or wast e materials such as used oils, paints, solvents 
and a certain amount of biomass are used.  
The clinker leaves the kiln at approximatel y 1500°C, and is then released onto a high-
efficiency grate cooler with air injection contro l grate plates, where it is cooled to 100°C by 
means of air exchange. Some of this air enters  t h e  k i l n  b y  t h e  f l u e  e f f e c t  a s  s e c o n d a r y  
combustion air, and some goes to the tertiary air duct while the remainder is released into 
the atmosphere after being purifi ed through the pertinent filter. 
 Similar to case A, the clinker is mixed with the additives and is ground, but this time, in a 
vertical mill with a highly efficient turbosepar ator that allows the fineness of the cement to 
be controlled by centrifugal force. Just like the other two cases, the final size of the particles 
is roughly 30 microns. Finally the product is packaged and stored until it is shipped.  
Results and discussion 
The results obtained with the computation t ool are summarized in Table 4 to make them

Table 4.  CO 2 emissions from different “inputs” (in tCO 2/year) 
Based on the results obtained and reported  i n  t h e  p r e v i o u s  s e c t i o n ,  t h e  f o l l o w i n g  
observations can be drawn:  
(1) By dividing the total footprint (1,003,555.2 tCO 2/year for case A, 902,440.8 tCO 2/year for 
case B and 790,278.3 tCO 2/year for case C) by the productivi ty (1,000,000 t/year), it is possible 
to obtain the amount of CO 2 that must be released to manufacture a ton of cement. These 
values are 1.00 tCO 2/tcement for case A, 0.90 tCO 2/tcement for case B and 0.79 tCO 2/tcement 
for case C. Therefore, the carbon footprint of cement may be considered high in theory. We 
are well aware of the enormous effort the sector  has made over the years in attempting to 
reduce their CO 2 emissions by applying a number of di fferent techniques, but there are still 
areas left to be explored and completed. In vi ew of the results, some guidelines aimed at 
reducing CO 2 emissions in cement plants can be obtained:  
Fuels and electric energy : Both direct and indirect emissions, easily account for the greatest 
part of the total footprint (75.33%+3.89% in case  A and 77.06%+4.28% in case C). In case B, 
they seem to be lower (only 0.73%+2.02%) but that  is just because a grinding plant does not 
need to use the kilns but it will do incorp orate the intrinsic footprint of the purchased 
clinker (included into the materials category). It  is also clear how the use of BAT allows for 
the reduction of the sum of direct an d indirect emission s from 795,045.3 tCO 2/year (case A) 
to 642,827.8 tCO 2/year (case C); i.e., a reduction of 152,217.5 t CO 2/year (nearly  20%). Some 
possible measures would be the use of secondary fuels and sustainable energy sources or 
the reduction of the percentage of clinker in cements. 
Materials : the footprint produced by materials is not too large in cases A (15,810.6 
tCO 2/year) and C (15,710.4 tCO 2/year) accounting for 1.58% and 1.99% of their total  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 34 
footprints, respectively. However, owing to  t h e  e n o r m o u s ,  b u t  u n a v o i d a b l e  a m o u n t  o f  
outsourced clinker purchased by plant B, along with the fact th at this material has a large 
intrinsic footprint, in th e case of the grinding plant, it is the materials category that accounts, 
without a doubt, for the greatest part of the total footprint (74.66%), reaching an absolute 
value of 677,435.7 tCO 2/year. For this reason, the lines of action taken to reduce the footprint 
should be based on more sustainable constr uctions and the optimization of the use of 
aggregates and minerals in general, but above all,  in case B, it is primordial to reduce the 
amount of clinker in cement. 
Services and contracts : it is not a highly significant category in cases A (2,818.3 tCO 2/year, 
the 0.28%) and C (2,825.1 tCO 2/year, the 0.36%) but it really is in case B, where the fact that 
the clinker must be imported with its cons equent transport by ship, raises case B CO 2 
emissions to 131,728.7 tCO 2/year (14.52% of its total footprint). In general, this footprint can 
be reduced by contracting the services of the most efficient companies in environmental 
terms. Another category of importance is the contracting of “office” services with a high 
added value, whose carbon footprint can be redu ced mainly by saving on energy. In case B, 
it is clear that the best way forward is to find more efficient and sustainable means of 
transport for the imported clinker as well as  c l o s e r  s u p p l i e r s ,  w h a t  w o u l d  m i n i m i z e  t h e  
necessary traveled distances (despite the fact that the China is currently the largest export 
market owing to its low prices). 
The agricultural and fishing footprints : this category has not been introduced into the 
analysis. This category is usually  the first to be omitted for reas ons of discipline although  it 
can take on great importance in certain busi nesses and multinational companies, owing to 
the expenses incurred from trav el, and the resulting cost in sustenance (not to mention 
company dinners, social events and invitations). 
Forestry footprint : this footprint does not have very hi gh values in relation to the total 
footprint (8,746.2 tCO 2/year in case A, 8,840.7 tCO 2/year in case B and 8,734.7 tCO 2/year in 
case C) with incidence percentages of 0.87% , 0.98% and 1.11% respectively. However, it 
should be controlled by making sure that the w ood is certified and that it comes from forests 
managed under sustainable development programs and by demanding cellulose and wood 
products from suppliers with a small footprint or with plans to reduce their footprint. The 
forestry footprint that cannot be reduced should be offset by the counter footprint. At the 
present time there are companies that invest in cr eating forests, parks, pastures, etc. in order 
to increase their counter footprint, thereby decr easing their total net footprint. Therefore, the 
investment of natural capital in non-company owned land or even distant pieces of land 
should not be ruled out.    
Water footprint : What is striking in this case is the great reduction achieved by using the 
best available techniques, decreasi ng the consumption from 269,725.0 m3/year in case A to 
78,462.0 m3/year in case C (which is equal to a reduction of 659.9 tCO 2/year in case A to 192.0 
tCO 2/year of case C, i.e., a reduction of 71%). Not only the new production techniques were 
important in this case, but also BAT are now be ing used for the selective collection of water 
whereby consumption is reduced through recyc ling techniques, collection of rainwater,  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 35 
greywater and others. In general terms, pota ble water (which requires a distribution 
network, pumping facilities, potablization pr ocesses, etc. and unnecessarily adding an 
enormous footprint to the product) should never be used for in dustrial processes. 
Soil use : plants type A and C require much more so il than plant type B. Therefore, while the 
footprints of cases A and C (58.2 and 56.8 tCO 2/year respectively), that of case B is 9.6 
tCO 2/year. Generally speaking, the footprint corresponding to this concept is small, which is 
no reason not to optimize this occupied spac e to the maximum. Moreover, the footprint can 
be reduced by means of counter footprint, fo r instance, new green zones and garden areas 
that form part of the property where the cement  plants are located and which also serve as a 
screen of vegetation to combat contamination. 
Waste materials : this category accounts for the 17.98% in case A, 6.54% in case B and 15.18% 
in case C, so they are all substantially high values, which would indicate that any influence 
exerted on them would lead to considerable  s a v i n g s  i n  t h e  t o t a l  f o o t p r i n t ,  w h a t  w a s  
demonstrated by the achieved reduction of th e waste material footprint (33.52%) which the 
use of BAT technologies got.  
(2) Comparing the results A and C, it can be said  that while the best available techniques are 
a complete solution, they allowed an  i m p o r t a n t  r e d u c t i o n  o f  2 1 3 , 2 7 6 . 9  t C O 2/year (21.25%  
of total emissions, from 1,003,555.2 tCO 2/year in case A to 790,278.3 tCO 2/year in case  
C). Summarized in Table 5 we can see the reductions depending on the consumption 
category. 
 
CONSUMPTION CATEGORIES Reduction (%)
Footprint of direct emissions  19.45 
Footprint of indirect emissions  13.35 
Footprint of materials 0.63 
Footprint of services and contracts -0.24 
Agricultural and fishing footprint   0.00 
Forestry footprint  0.13 
Water footprint 70.90 
Soil use footprint   2.41 
Footprint from wastes  33.52 
Soil use counter footprint  0.00 
Table 5.  Reduction of the percentage of the footprint a ccording to consumption categories, thanks to 
the use of BATs  
On the one hand, it is clear, even at first glance, how important are these techniques, 
above all, as far as the consumption of fuel, energy and water as well as waste emissions 
(particularly solid particles) are concern. On the other hand, they do not reduce other  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 36 
considerable footprints, such as the footprint of materials or that of services and 
contracts which even got worse. This singular effect is explained by the fact that the BAT 
need tend to involve more complicated proce sses, the human factor of control, security, 
projects and planning, etc. beco me more necessary, and this results in an increase of the 
footprint. 
(3) As mentioned, case B does not include some  important processes, such as pre-heating, 
burning in the kiln or cooling of  the clinker. This way, it presents less consumption of fuel 
and electricity by saving on these high ener gy consumption operations. Moreover, it also 
has a lower demand for soil (since these are sma ller plants) and a smaller quantity of wastes 
(for instance, solid particles present in the ex haust gases from combustion in the clinker 
kiln). However, it presents a greater consum ption of raw materials since imported clinker 
must be purchased and transported from dist ant points of manufacture (generally from 
China).  So the smaller footprint of this option  i s  o n l y  d u e  t o  t h a t  fact that the intrinsic 
footprint included in the imported clinker come s only from the energy  footprint and not the 
total footprint.  
Methodologies like MC3 allow for the inclus ion of the intrinsic footprint of the 
materials consumed by means of their ener gy intensity or their embodied energy, but 
there are other factors such as the consumption of water needed to manufacture them, 
services and contracts involved in their ma nufacture, the demand  f o r  s o i l ,  f o r e s t r y  
resources, etc. that the meth odology is unable to process [21] and for this reason a 
slightly lower value was obtained. In fact if the plant that manufactures the clinker in  
China were similar to that plant, for example in case A, the final footprint that should 
be obtained in case B, would be the one pertaining to case A, along with the added 
footprint of transporting the clinker from Ch ina (since in case A this process is not 
carried out).  
With this, what we are attempting to clarify is  that by building grinding plants instead of 
integral plants, we are far from solving the problem of CO 2 e m i s s i o n s ,  i n s t e a d  w e  a r e  
transferring the problem from one country to  a n o t h e r  ( g e n e r a l l y  t o  t h e  l e s s  d e v e l o p e d  
countries), for reasons related to the cost of en ergy, labor, etc. Therefore, if we analyze the 
situation in global terms, the problem is aggr avated even more, since the technologies of 
these countries are generally less efficient an d the long chains of merchandise supply and 
transport become a necessity.  
4. Conclusion 
Like it or not, our planet is finite and a finite system is incompatible with an economic 
subsystem whose paradigm is based on continuous and unlimited growth. Somehow we 
have to reconcile growth and sustainability, and to do so, our companies need to access 
transparent and comparable information to be ab le to make the best decisions so as not to 
compromise either their growth or th e impact on the planetary ecosystem.  
A New Perspective for Labeling the Carb on Footprint Against Climate Change 37 
In answer to this, Carbonfeel has been de signed with a core mission: to organize 
information and knowledge on the carbon footprint, making it universally useful and 
accessible to all society. In short, the point is  to provide companies with the best available 
techniques for calculation and exchange of information within the processes of inventory, 
management, reduction and offsetting of  G H G  e m i s s i o n s  g e n e r a t e d  b y  t h e i r  o w n  
activities. 
This information will allow companies to partic ipate actively in improving their behavior, 
without having any effect on their business. Qu ite the contrary; their activities will start to 
focus on production patterns based on eco-effici ency and eco-design, and therefore lead to a 
reduction in costs. Moreover, customers will recognize a continuous improvement effort 
based on a credible label supported by many different certifiers, consultants, companies, 
associations, universities and others. 
Carbonfeel starts out from a methodological  b a s i s  p r o p o s e d  b y  t h e  C o m p o u n d  M e t h o d  
based on Financial Accounts (MC3), inherited fr om the ecological footprint concept that has 
been extended worldwide by its creators Will iam Rees and Mathis Wackernagel. The project 
takes advantage of other emerging methodolog ical trends such as GHG Protocol, PAS 2050 
or ISO 14064 standards and the future ISO 14067 and 14069, in order to get an 
approximation of the real calculation. 
Supporting an integrated approach, the incorporation of information technologies makes 
Carbonfeel an innovative project that has burs t into the market to completely change the 
focus of the classic studies of life cycle anal ysis, whose drawbacks in cost and study time 
had already been reported  by different analysts. 
The great paradox of the Carbonfeel method is that companies get a carbon footprint  
at the corporate level and the life cycle of all products and services without any 
restriction on the scopes, with  the information provided in great detail. Moreover, this 
information is more extensive and of a higher  q u a l i t y  a s  i t  i s  b a s e d  o n  p r i m a r y  d a t a  
(real footprint of its suppliers),  and all at a cost and a time frame fully accessible to any 
corporation. 
The telematic assembly technique provides an entire life cycle, where each corporation 
analyzes its own emissions (scope 1 and land use) on an autonomous basis for calculating 
the indirect footprint or inherited from it s suppliers by the telematic assembly. The 
company stops worrying about the tracking of em issions that are out of view (scope 3 in 
the approach to corporate and upstream appr oach to product based on LCAs) and focuses 
exclusively on the part of their responsibilit y, the direct emissions and the organization’s 
land use. Therefore, time of calculation is drastically reduced, making it assumable to all 
the business.  
The 'green coin' can become a reality if we pay attention to the technological factor faced by 
the carbon footprint as a prob lem of information exchange.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 38 
A Carbonfeel project offers companies a real environmental accounting method based on a 
universal indicator such as the carbon footprin t, which analyzes the corporation and each of 
the products and services generated. 
Finally, the application of the organization-product-based-life-cycle assessment  
methodology (MC3) to three types of cement facilities in Spain (case A pertaining to a 
conventional integral plant, case B which refers  to a grinding plant and case C, an integral 
plant which has been subject to the best availa ble techniques BAT) shows that if we compare 
results A and C, the best available techniques  allow an important reduction of 213,276.9 
tCO 2/year (21.25% of total emissions, from 1,003,555.2 tCO 2/year in case A to 790,278.3 
tCO 2/year in case C).

1. Introduction 
The development of vapour compression refrig erating units was strictly related to the 
characteristics of the working fluid from the beginning of thei r commercial diffusion.  
Initially, natural substances were employed, su ch as ethyl ether, methyl ether, dimethyl 
ether, carbon dioxide, ammonia, sulphuric a nhydride and methyl chloride. Potential users 
of the refrigerating equipment were somewhat diffident because of their toxicity and/or 
flammability. Most first generation refrigerant fluids were retired for safety reasons. Some, 
such as ammonia and hydrocarbo ns, survived or were later re vived for limited applications 
in which their risks were manageable, such as industrial or small-charge systems. 
Apparently, all safety problems were overcome with the appearance of the first, non toxic, 
non-flammable chloro-fluoro-hydrocarbon (CFC). Further chloro-fluoronated compounds 
followed, originating either from methane or from ethane by partial HCFC or total CFC 
substitution of th e hydrogen atoms. 
The first global environment problem with th e second generation refrigerants was the 
depletion of stratospheric ozone. The problem arises from destruction of ozone molecules in 
the upper atmosphere, primarily by bromine an d chlorine from anthropogenic chemicals. 
The chlorine and bromine react catalytically to destroy ozone molecules, thereby reducing 
the natural shield from incoming ultraviolet- B radiation. Molina and Rowland [1] identified 
CFCs and HCFCs as a source for chlorine in the stratosphere and the potential for more 
serious ozone depletion, with projected growth in use of these chemicals. The index used to 
indicate the relative ability of a refrigerant or  other chemical to destroy stratospheric ozone 
is the Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP).  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 42 
ODP is defined for any given substance as the ratio between the ozone consumption per 
unit mass released in the atmosphere an d that consumed by the CFC R11 [2]. 
Chlorinated and brominated refr igerants, along with similar so lvents, foam blowing agents, 
aerosol propellants, fire suppressants, and ot her chemicals are being phased out under the 
Montreal Protocol, a landmark internationa l treaty to protect the ozone layer [3]. 
Therefore the Montreal Protocol forced abandonment of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) 
as refrigerants in current vapour-compressi on refrigeration systems. CFCs have been 
banned since 1996, with HCFCs for interim use. Indeed, their ODP, thou gh lower than that 
of the CFC, is different from zero [2]. The transition from HCFCs also is underway. The 
Montreal Protocol sets limits for the HCFC consumption (or cap), defined as production 
plus imports less exports and specified destruction: in 1996 (freeze at calculated cap), 2004 
(65% of cap), 2010 (25%), 2015 (10%), and 2020 (0.5%) with full consumption phase-out by 
2030 in non-Article 5 countries [3,4]. Individual countries adopted different response 
approaches. Most western and central-Europe an countries accelerated HCFC phase outs, 
while the majority of other developed countr ies set limits by phasing out propellant and 
blowing agent uses early, requiring phase-ou t of R-22 by 2010, and then banning all HCFC 
use in new equipment by 2020. The schedule fo r Article 5 countries begins with a freeze in 
2013 (based on 2009–2010 production and consumptio n levels) with declining limits starting 
in 2015 (90%), 2020 (65%), 2025 (32.5%), and 2030 (2.5%) followed by phase-out in 2040. 
Again, continued future use and service, even  after 2040, are allowed for existing equipment 
employing HCFC refrigerants until otherwise retired except as rest ricted by national 
regulations. Exports from Article 5 countries into non-Article 5 countries are effectively 
restricted to meet the more stringent non-Arti cle 5 schedules. To avoid separate domestic 
and export products and to exploit newer te chnologies derived from joint ventures and 
licensing agreements, some prod ucts in Article 5 countries in corporate replacements earlier 
than required. 
The HFCs are a new family of substances that are candidates for substitution of both CFCs 
and HCFCs. HFCs, in fact, are entirely harmle ss towards the ozone-layer, since they do not 
contain chlorine. 
Now a further problem must be considered, the so-called greenhouse effect stemming from 
the capture of infrared radiation by some comp onents of the atmosphere [5,6]. The average 
temperature at the surface of our planet result s from an equilibrium between incoming solar 
energy and heat radiated back into space. Most of the latter is in the infrared range of 
emissions. Gases that absorb this infrared  energy enhance the greenhouse effect of our 
atmosphere, leading to warming of the Earth. Human activities have increased substantially 
the concentration of greenhouse gases. As a result, a substantial warming of the earth 
surface and atmosphere occurred that might ad versely affect the natural ecosystem. Over 
the last hundred years, the mean temperatures  have increased by 0. 3-0.6 °C. Doubling the 
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is likely to yield a further temperature increase 
by 1.5-4.5 °C [7,8]. Refrigerants have been id entified as greenhouse gases. The impact of a 
given greenhouse gas on global warming is quantified by its GWP (Global Warming The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 43 
Potential). GWP is defined as the mass of CO 2 that would yield the same net impact on 
global warming as the release of a single unit (kg) of the given atmospheric component. The 
GWP values used in this paper are relative to  a 100 years Integration Time Horizon. Shorter 
integration periods emphasize near-term effect s, while longer intervals better reflect the 
total impact of a release. Carbone dioxide is  u s e d  a s  t h e  r e f e r e n c e  c h e m i c a l  f o r  G W P s  
because it is the one between natural gases wi th the greatest net im pact. Other chemicals, 
including most refrigerants, are more potent as greenhouse gases.  
In December 1997 more than 160 nations met in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate binding 
limitations on greenhouse gases for the developed nations, pursuant to the objectives of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on C limate Change (UNFCCC). The outcome of the 
meeting was the Kyoto Protocol [9], in whic h the developed nations agree to limit their 
greenhouse gases emissions, relative to the leve ls emitted in 1990. The Protocol is subjected 
to ratification, acceptance, approval or accessi on by Parties to the Convention. Due to the 
voluntary characteristics of the Protocol some countries have no targets under the Protocol, 
but the protocol reaffirms the commitments of the Framework Convention by all Parties to 
formulate and implement climate change mi tigation and adaptation programs. Even 
countries such as the United States of America that have not formally signed onto the Kyoto 
Accord have introduced their own plans to aggressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
National laws and regulations implementing the Kyoto Protocol differ from one another, 
but they typically prohibit avoidable releases of HFC refrigerants. In some countries, their 
use undergoes control and/or taxation. More recent measures (eithe r already adopted or 
proposed) at local level (regional, national, municipal) are even more stringent. These 
restrictions are forcing the shift to a fourth generation of refrigerants with both ODP and 
GWP regulations [10]. 
In the field of the mobile refrigeration syst ems, the European Parliament already set a 
regulation of F-Gases phase out [11] that bans the use of refrigerants having GWPs 
exceeding 150 (based on 100 years integration time  horizon). Such regulation begins in 2011, 
and will be effective for all air conditioners of new automobiles in 2017 . 
However, the EU Parliament [12] rejected recommended measures that would have banned 
HFCs as aerosol propellants by 2006, as foam bl owing agents by 2009, an d as refrigerants in 
stationery air conditioners and refrigeration by 2010.  
2. The TEWI concept

increase from 25.028 million metric tons in  2 0 0 3  t o  3 3 . 6 6 3  m i l l i o n  m e t r i c  t o n s  i n  2 0 1 5  an d  
43.676 million metric tons in 2030. Electricity ac tually causes more ca rbon dioxide emissions 
than all other anthropogenic sources. Accordin g to the Energy Industry Administration in 
the United States, electricity generates 39% of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide 
emissions. These emissions are expected to gr ow by almost 45% over the next 25 years and 
grow to 42% of the total carbon dioxide emissions.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 44 
In order to reduce the production of greenhouse gases, it is reasonable to assume that we 
should focus on the reduction of emission s in both electricity and transportation. 
According to US Department of Energy [13-15] , the largest single use for electricity is 
lighting (27%) followed by cooling (refrigeration and air conditioning) at 15%, as shown in

Therefore in order to reduce the CO 2 emissions caused by electric ity a good option is to 
reduce the refrigeration and air conditioning emissions. 
Vapour compression plants produce both a dire ct and an indirect contribution to global 
warming. The former depends on the GWP of refrigerant fluids and on the fraction of 
refrigerant charge which is released into the atmosphere during operation and maintenance, 
or is not recovered when the system is scrappe d [16,17]. The indirect contribution is energy-
related. In fact, a vapour compression refriger ator requires electrical energy produced by a 
power plant that typically bu rns a fossil fuel releasing CO 2 into the atmosphere.  
The concept of total equivalent warming im pact (TEWI) was developed to combine the 
effect of direct refrigerant emission with those due to energy consumption and the related 
combustion of fossil fuels for the electric en ergy production. TEWI provides a measure of 
the environmental impact of greenhouse gases originating from operation, service and end-
of-life disposal of the equipment. TEWI is the sum of the direct contribution of the The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 45 
greenhouse gases used to make or to operate the systems and the indirect contribution of 
carbon dioxide emissions result ing from the energy required to  run the systems along their 
normal lifetime [18].  
The TEWI is calculated as [19-21] :

The direct global warming effect of refriger ant fluids, stemming from the absorption they 
produce of long-wave radiations, depends on th eir GWP and on the frac tion of refrigerant 
charge released into the atmosphere. The last is mainly due to leakage during the plant 
operational life time (P L) and to the residual amounts which, according to the current state 
of technology, are not recyclable and thus are released into the atmosphere when taking the 
plant out of operation (1-P R). 
As already stated, the indirect contribution to  TEWI consists in the so-called energy-related 
contribution. Indeed, an elec trical refrigerator requires  e l e c t r i c a l  e n e r g y  f r o m  a  C O 2 
releasing power plant that typically burns a fossil fuel. The amount of CO 2 e m i t t e d  i s  a  
function of the refrigerator COP, of the power plant efficiency and of the fuel used in the 
conversion plant that affect the emissions per unit energy converted [22]. When a fuel is 
burnt, energy is produced an d carbon dioxide and other chemicals, mostly water, are 
produced. The ratio of CO 2 emitted to the electricity generated differs according to the type 
of fuel used. Electricity is generated from a ra nge of fuels including nuclear, gas, oil, coal 
and in some cases waste. Besides burning a fuel there are several other alternative to 
produce electricity like hydroele ctric plants, wind power, geothermal energy sources, tidal 
power, photovoltaic panels etc. 
The relationship between CO 2 production and electricity generation may vary significantly, 
depending on the approach to be followed. In Figure 2 are reported the best values of CO 2 
emissions by primary energy sources taken fr om the reference providing the most recent 
data. 
The typical power-plant technology adopted vari es, therefore each country and each region 
inside each country has its own mix of primar y sources for electricity generation. This mix 
can change significantly from country to country and even from one region to another in the 
same country. 
The literature provides some indicative, average levels of CO 2 release per KWh of electrical 
energy ( ΅) for various countries [23-26]. Table 1 report s a values for different continents and, 
in each continent for different countrie s. In Table 1 are reported a range of ΅ values and the 
“best value” for each country.

Figure 2.  Average CO 2 emissions by primary energy source. 
In order to understand direct and indirect contributions impact on the greenhouse gases 
emissions typical household and light commercial refrigeration systems (cooling capacity 
below 1 kW at LBP ASHRAE conditions) were chosen for three representative market 
around the world (North America, Europe and Asia). Each system was tested following the 
energy consumption standards of each region and the results are presented in Table 2.  
The concept of TEWI in this study is used to identify the global warming impact for each 
equipment and market region. 
For calculation purposes an a nnual leakage rate of 5% was adopted. This value was an 
intermediary value for household and light commercial applications. A mean value of life 
expectancy for refrigeration equipment in this  study was 10 years. A recycling of 75% was 
considered for both household and light comme rcial applications. This means that 75% of 
the refrigerant charge is recovered at the end of the equipment useful life. 
The results are shown in Figure 4.

Table 2.  Typical refrigeration equipment per market region. 
Figure 5 clearly shows the strong influence of indirect effect due to energy consumption on 
the total CO 2 e m i s s i o n s .  I n  t h e  N o r t h  A m e r i c a n  m a rket the direct co ntribution in the 
household applications ranges between 16 and 23%, in light commercial between 11 and 
12%. In Europe, due to the use of hydrocarbons as refrigeran ts in household applications, 
direct contribution has practically no contri bution to the TEWI. In the light commercial 
applications the direct contribution ranges  b e t w e e n  2  a n d  2 5 % ,  w i t h  t h e  h i g h e r  v a l u e s  
associated to the refrigerant fluid with high er GWP. The situation in Asia for household 
applications is very similar to Europe due to the use of hydrocarbons. Light commercial 
applications in Asia show a direct contribution of 10 %. 
Therefore regardless of the market region and ty pe of refrigerant system , indirect effect to 
global warming always represents the prev alent contribution to  global warming. 
From the previous data a sensitivity analysis can be carried out employing two different 
scenarios. In the first one the refrigerants were replaced by  a  n e w  r e f r i g e r a n t  w i t h  a  l o w  
GWP, for example 1 and the energy consumptions was held constant. The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of

Figure 5.  Direct and indirect CO 2 emissions percentage for different application. 
In Figure 6 are reports the results of the first scenario in terms of ̇TEWI/TEWI. 
The Figure 6 clearly shows that in the No rth America market the replacement of the 
refrigerant fluid with a unitary GWP refrigeran t decreases the TEWI from -24 to -16 % in 
household application, from-12 to -11 % in light commercial applications. In the European 
and Asian market, due to current use of hydrocarbons in household applications, the 
replacement of the refrigerant fluid does not provide any additional benefit. Whereas in  
the light commercial application in the European market the TEWI decreases between -24 
and – 2%, in the Asian market decreases of about -10%. 
A second scenario the energy  con su m ption was redu ced by  30% and the refrigerant fluid 
was not changed. In Figure 7 are reports the results of the first scenario in terms of

Figure 6.  ̇TEWI/TEWI replacing the refrigerant fluid with a low GWP fluid. 
The figure clearly shows that improving the energy efficiency by 30%, in the North America 
Market the TEWI decreases between -47 and - 38 %, in the European market between -47  
and -30%, in the Asian market between -37 and -30%. 
The previous analysis clearly sh ows that the indirect effect on TEWI is stronger than the 
direct one in the household and light commercial applications regardless of the market 
region. Therefore it seems more effective, in order to decrease  the global warming impact of 
a refrigeration system, to focu s the attention on the improvem ent of the energy efficiency. 
To this aim the replacement of a refriger ant fluid with one with low GWP but that 
introduces penalties to the equipm ent efficiency, must be avoided.

3. An experimental evaluation of the greenhouse effect in R22 
substitution with R407C 
3.1. R22 substitution with R407C 
R22 is an HCFC with an ODP of 0.05 and a GWP of 1700 and is the most widely used 
refrigerant today in commercial, domestic and industrial applications, and its phase-out will 
impact a large number of plants in the worl d. Therefore retrofitti ng these systems would 
alleviate the R22 phase-out problem. This opport unity could be cheaper than the installation 
of new plants, especially for su permarkets, data centers, factories and hospitals. Refrigerant 
replacement candidates have been checked for environmental and safety requirements, 
compatibility with lubricant oil, filters, and se aling. In order to establish the best substitute 
in a specified system among the candidates , it is necessary to estimate energetic 
performances after refrigerant replacement. In the last years, many companies have 
expended much effort to develop and characterize refrigerants able to increase the energetic 
efficiency of a refrigeration system, depending on its application. Similarly many The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 53 
researchers have investigated the energetic performances of the newest substitutes of R22 
[27,28].  
During this transition period , many industrial and commercia l applications used R407C to 
retrofit R22. The latter is the only drop-in su bstitute, and is an HFC with zero ODP and a 
GWP (1700) lower than that of R22. R407C is a zeotropic mixture of R32/R125/R134A 
(23/25/52 % in weight). 
Even if R407C has thermo-physical properties similar to those of R22 and it is non-
flammable and non-toxic, it is incompatib le with mineral or alkyl-benzene oil. 
Consequently, the R22 retrofit with R407C implies the adoption of polyester oil. 
In the preset paper an experimental comparis on between TEWI of R22 and R407C has been 
carried with a vapour compression pilot plant [29]. 
3.2. The experimental apparatus 
The experimental apparatus is reported in Figure 8 and consists of three loops: the 
refrigerant loop, the condensing  water loop and the evaporating water-glycol loop [30].

The refrigerant loop is a vapour compression plant consisting in a semihermetic compressor, 
a plate condenser connected to a liquid receiver , a thermostatic valve and a plate evaporator. 
The water loop is used for cooling the refrigerant flowing in the plant. It consists in the 
condenser, a circulation pump, an inertial tank , an air operated coo ling exchanger and three 
plate heat exchangers. The refrigerant duty consists in a wa ter-glycol mixture (70/30 % in 
weight) continuously heated in the three interm ediate plate heat exchangers by means of the 
water condensing loop. Whenever required, additional heating is provided by three 
electrical resistances inserted into an iner tial tank (maximum power 12 kW). The water-
glycol loop consists in the evaporator, a circulation pump and an inertial tank. 
In the main loop measurements are performed of: the pressure and f the temperature at the 
inlet and at the outlet of each device, the mass-flow rate at the outlet of the liquid receiver 
and the electrical power supplied to the compre ssor. As regards the water-glycol loop, the 
temperature at the inlet and outlet of the evap orator, at the intermed iate heat exchangers, 
and at the inertial tank are determined. Meas urements are carried ou t of the volumetric 
flowrate at the inlet of the tank and also of the electrical power supplied to the resistances. 
The secondary loop at the condensed has been instrumented in a similarly way. A detailed 
indication of sensor position  is provided in Figure 8. 
Pressures are measured by piezoelectric transduc ers (P) in the pressure ranges are 0 – 7 bar 
and 0 – 30 bar with an accuracy of + 0.5 % F.S.  Temperature are measured by means of four-
wire 100  ̛ platinum resistance thermometers (T) with  an accuracy of + 0.15 K. The electric 
power input to the compressor and that required  by the electrical resistances are measured 
by a Watt transducer with an accuracy of + 0.2 %. Refrigerant mass flow rate is measured by 
a Coriolis effect mass flow-meter (M) with an accuracy of + 0.2 %. 
Two turbine flow-meters are employed for measuring the co ndensing water volumetric flow 
rate (v) and that of the water-glycol mixtur e circulating in the evaporator (v) with an 
accuracy of + 0.2 5%. 
According to Tables 3 and 4, different experi mental situations are determined by varying 
the operating conditions.  
Table 3 reports T w,in,co /Tw,out,co  (the inlet and the outlet temperature at the condenser water 
side) and TMT wg (the mean thermodynamic temperature of the water glycol mixture). Table 
3 reports three different set of runs. In each se t of runs, the values of  t h e  i n l e t  a n d  o u t l e t  
temperature at the condenser water side have been kept constant, whereas TMT wg has been 
varied . The tests conducted at 30 /35 and 35/40 °C re fer to a refrigeration plant, whereas the 
tests at 45/50 °C refer to a heat pump. 
Table 4 reports TMTwg and Tco, i.e. the conden sing temperature of the refrigerant fluid (as 
regards R407C, that is an azeotropic mixture,  a mean temperature between dew and bubble 
point was considered). Table 4 reports three differe nt sets of run. In ea ch set the values of

3.3. Results and discussion 
3.3.1. The direct contribution 
This contribution has been evalua ted, referring to the experiment al plant, on the basis of the 
measured charge of the plant pertaining to R22 and to R407C and by  assuming refrigerant 
leaks in terms of fraction  of refrigerant charge. 
The direct contributions to the greenhouse e ffect to R22 and to R407C during the plant 
useful life corresponds to the same net impact  on global warming as the release of 6375 and 
5400 kg of carbon dioxide, respectively.  
The R22 direct contribution is about 15 % grea ter than the R407C one, a direct consequence 
of the greater GWP and charge pertaining to R22. 
3.3.2. The indirect contribution 
The thermodynamic parameter that affects th is contribution is the coefficient of 
performance of the plant. In the following Figs  9-11, is shown the behaviour of the COP for 
different experimental situations. Those fi gures are referred to the test conditions 
pertaining to different inlet and outlet water temperatures in the condenser (30/35, 35/40, 
45/50 °C), and then to different refrigeran t condensing temperatures. The first two 
diagrams refer to a refrigerant plant, wherea s the third diagram accounts for a heat pump. 
In all instances, COP increases with wate r glycol mean thermodynamic temperature. 
Indeed, with increasing the la tter, both the refrigerating du ty and the mechanical power 
consumption at the compressor increase. The re lative increase of the former, however, 
exceeds that of the latter. As a consequence, COP increases. For all the experimental runs 
conducted, the performance coefficient of R407C  i s  l o w e r  t h a n  t h a t  p e r t a i n i n g  t o  R 2 2 .  
Therefore, the indirect contribu tion to the greenhouse effect of  R407C is always higher than 
of R22. 
The broken line reported in the previous di agrams estimates a theoretical COP value for 
R407C (COP407C*) that might compensate for the higher direct contribution of R22 to the 
greenhouse effect for this plant in the same operating conditions. 
Indeed, if the R407C COP* were about 5% lo wer than that or R22, the greater direct 
contribution of the latter would be balanced by employing the former  in the summer cycle 
(refrigeration). Unfortunately,  a s  s h o w n  i n  f i g u r e  9  a n d  1 0 , the actual value of the COP 
pertaining to R407C is lower than that corresponding to this theo retical value (COP407C*). 
Therefore, under these experimental conditions, R407C has a greater greenhouse effect than 
R22. At this stage, however, the difference ca n not be determined qu antitatively. In runs 
performed with water inlet and outlet temperat ure of 30 and 35 °C, respectively, the COP of 
R407C is lower than that pertaining to R22 by  8-11 %. In r uns with water inlet and outlet 
temperature of 35 and 340 °C, respectively, the COP of R407C is lower by 16-19%. Therefore, 
the difference between the actual  COP value and COP* of R407C is remarkable, especially in 
the 35/40 °C runs. The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 57 
On the contrary, the best performance is achi eved with inlet and outlet water temperature 
of 45 and 50 °C, respectively, corresponding to a winter cycle (heat pump). In this case, the 
COP* pertaining to R407C that might compen sate the higher direct contribution of R22 
were about 3% lower than that of R22. Inde ed, the actual COP value of R407C is always 
about 3.2% lower than that pertaining to R22, except for the run at TMTwg=7.4 °C. In this 
case, it is 6.6% lower. The difference between  the actual COP value and COP* of R407C is 
in this case lower.  
The less satisfactory situation corresponds  t o  t h e  r u n  w i t h  w a t e r  i n l e t  a n d  o u t l e t  
temperature of 35 and 40°C, respectively. 
A set of runs have been conducted by keeping the mean thermodynamic water glycol 
temperature and the refrigerant duty constant and by varying the condensation temperature 
of the refrigerant fluids in order to bett er clarify the reason of this behaviour. 
The results of the runs obtained with TMTw g =10 °C are summarized in figure 12. Similar 
results are obtained in all the experimental runs performed with ot her water glycol mean 
temperatures reported in Table 5.

For both fluids, the COP decreases with the co ndensation temperature. The shape of the two 
curves, however, is such that the maximum COP difference is achieved at intermediate 
value of the condensation temperatures (46-48°C). The value of the condensation 
temperature pertaining to the corresponding run performed with water inlet and outlet 
temperatures of 35/40 °C  fall in this range. 
The general behaviour of the experimental results can be explained in the light of the 
dependence of the compressor duty on th e compression ratio. The compressor duty 
increases nonlinearly with the compression ratio. The compression ratio increases with the 
condensing temperature at equal mean thermodynamic temperature and, therefore, at equal 
evaporating pressure. Therefore,  COP decreases with increasing compression duty at equal 
refrigerant duty.

3.3.3. Overall evaluation 
The TEWI has been evaluated as a function of  the mean thermodynamic temperature of the 
water glycol mixture at the evaporator. 
The results are summarised in Figs 13-15. 
According to the previous discussion, in Figs . 13 and 14, the TEWI pertaining to R407C is 
greater than that corresponding to R22. The difference ranges from a minimum of 2.3 to a 
maximum of 4.3 % in the runs pe rformed at 30/35 °C. The effect is even more marked in the 
runs performed at 35/40 °C (about 11%). This yi elds an increased CO2 emission of about 320 
kg/year for the plant under consideration when  w o r k i n g  a s  a  r e f r i g e r a t o r  w i t h  R 4 0 7 C  a s  
compared to R22. 
On the contrary, the two fluids are virtually eq uivalent in terms of greenhouse effect, when 
the plant acts as a heat pump in the winter cycle (40/45 °C runs, Fig. 15).

Figure 16 reports the overall results for the re versible heat pump working for the whole year 
(both in winter and summer cycle). It can be seen that the TEWI pertaining to R407C is 
slightly larger than that of R22 (2.7-4.7%). This corresponds to an increased CO 2 production 
of about 87 kg/year. 
In Figure 17, the TEWI difference ( ̇TEWI) between the two fluids is reported as a function 
of the condensation temperature for three different values of mean thermodynamics

maximum in the intermediate range of condensa tion temperatures. On the contrary, for high 
condensation temperature, ̇TEWI becomes negative. In the condensation temperature 
range explored, the ̇TEWI decreases with increasing me an thermodynamic temperature of 
the refrigerant duty. 
3.4. Concluding remarks 
The problem of R22 substitution with R407C in  t e r m s  o f  g l o b a l  w a r m i n g  e f f e c t  h a s  b e e n  
examined. R407C is harmless as far as ozone is  c o n c e r n e d .  I t  y i e l d s ,  h o w e v e r ,  a  n e g a t i v e  
contribution to the greenhouse effect, both directly with a GWP of 1600 and indirectly, 
because of the lower energetic effi ciency that results in higher CO 2 emissions. 
Experimental readings have been carried ou t on a vapour compression pilot plant. The 
contribution to the greenhouse effect has been taken account by evaluating the TEWI values.  The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 63 
The analysis of the experime ntal runs leads to the conclusion that the R22 direct 
contribution to the greenhouse effect is greate r than that pertaining to R407C (+15%). The 
COP corresponding to R407C is 3.3-19% lower than that pertaining to R22. The indirect 
contribution of the former is, th erefore, always higher than that  of the latter. Therefore, the 
final result depends on the operating conditions adopted in the experimental runs.  
The most unfavourable conditions are reached fo r the water inlet and outlet temperature at 
the condenser of 35-40 °C, respectively. This  s i t u a t i o n  c o r r e s p o n d s  t o  a  c o n d e n s a t i o n  
temperature in the range 43-47 °C and to an ev aporation temperature in the range -12/-7 °C. 
Under these conditions, the TEWI pertaining to R407C exceeds that of R22 by about 11%. 
Therefore, the substitution of  R 2 2  w i t h  R 4 0 7 C  s h o u l d  b e  u n acceptable in this specific 
situation if specific reference is  made to the greenhouse effect. 
On the contrary, the most favourable conditio ns are met for the water inlet and outlet 
temperature at the condenser of 45-50 °C, resp ectively. This situation corresponds to a 
condensation temperature in the range 53-58 °C  a n d  t o  a n  e v a p o r a t i o n  t e m p e r a t u r e  i n l e t  
range 2 – 10 °C. In this case , the two fluids behave in a similar way as regards the 
greenhouse effect.

Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 64 
For high evaporation temperatures, the TEWI of R407C is even slightly lower than that of 
R22. As a consequence, the subs titution of R22 with R407C is favourable, since no harm is 
produced to the ozone layer and no increase in CO 2 emission is made. As a final remark the 
substitution of R22 with R407C is convenient from the point of view of the greenhouse effect 
for high condensation (over 50°C) and evaporat ion temperatures of the refrigerant fluid. 
4. An experimental evaluation of the greenhouse effect in R22 
substitution with R422D 
4.1. R22 substitution with R422D 
As aforementioned, R22 is the most widely  u s e d  r e f r i g e r a n t  t o d a y  i n  c o m m e r c i a l ,  
domestic and industrial applications, and its phase-out will impact a large number of 
plants in the world. Therefore retrofitting these systems would alleviate the R22 phase-out 
problem. This opportunity could be cheaper than  the installation of new plants, especially 
for supermarkets, data centers, factories and hospitals. Refrigerant replacement 
candidates have been checked for environmen tal and safety requirements, compatibility 
with lubricant oil, filters, and sealing. In order to establish the best substitute in a 
specified system among the candidates, it is necessary to estimate energetic performances 
after refrigerant replacement. In the last years, many companies have expended much 
effort to develop and characterize refrigerants able to increase the energetic efficiency of a 
refrigeration system, depending on its application.. Even if R407C has thermo-physical 
properties similar to those of R22 and it is non-flammable and non-toxic, it is incompatible 
with mineral or alkyl-benzene oil. Consequently, the R22 retrofit with R407C implies the 
adoption of polyester oil, which requir es a difficult and expensive conversion. 
Furthermore, in comparison with R22, expe rimental tests carried out with R407C have 
pointed out a reduction in the energetic performances. Recent additions to the 
aforementioned alternative refrigerants for R22 are R422A, R422B, R422C and R422D. The 
U.S. environment protection agency reported these alternative refrigerants could be used 
for household and light commercial air conditioning applications. In particular, R422D is 
a zeotropic mixture of R134a/ R125/ R600a (31.5/65.1/3.4 % in weight) with no ODP and a 
GWP of 2230. This refrigerant fluid, originally was designed to replace R-22 in existing 
direct expansion water chiller systems. It can also be used in residential and commercial 
air conditioning and medium-temperature (and low) refrigeration systems. Minor 
equipment modifications (replacement of the filter drier and elastomeric seals/gaskets that 
are exposed to refrigerant, refill of oil if re quired) or components tuning may be required 
in some applications. It is also compatible wi th mineral oil and there is no need to replace 
it with synthetic oil. Field experience has shown that R422D provides performance that 
meets customer requirements in most retrof itted systems. It provides similar cooling 
capacity to R22 and it is capable to operat e at significantly lowe r compressor discharge 
temperature.  
In this scenario, it is seems se nsitive to inquire what is the actual impact of R422D on the 
environment, when it is employ ed in retrofitted R22 devices. It is well known that the GWP The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 65 
of R422D is higher than that of R22, but no t much is known about the energy efficiency of 
systems retrofitted by R422D. For this purpose, a comparison of  the energy consumptions of 
R22 and R422D for a direct expansion refriger ator applied to a commercial cold store is 
proposed. The experimental investigation has been carried out for different application 
conditions: medium temperature refrigeratio n for meat, fish, and dairy cases and high 
temperature refrigeration for air conditio ning and cooling of preparation room. 
Subsequently, we investigated into the possibility of reducing the environmental impact of 
retrofitting R22 systems with R422D by means of a sensitivity analysis of some of the 
functional parameters.  
4.2. Experimental facility 
The experimental vapor compression refrigeration plant, applied to a commercially 
available cold store as shown in Fig. 18, consists of a semi-hermetic reciprocating 
compressor, an air condenser followed by a liq uid receiver, a R22 mechanic thermostatic 
expansion valve to feed an air-cooled evaporator inside the cold store.  
The compressor, as declared by the manufactur er, can operate with the fluid R22 and it 
is lubricated with mineral oil. With an evaporation temperatur e range between -20  
to 10°C, a 35°C condensing temperature, an d utilizing R22 at the nominal frequency of 
50 Hz, the compressor refrigerating capacity is in the range of 1.4-4.4 kW. A blower 
drives the airflow through a thermally insulated channel where some electrical 
resistances are located with the objective of controlling the temperature of the airflow 
crossing the condenser. To fix the temperature of the airflow in accordance with  
the values sought, we changed the voltage supply of the electrical resistances by means 
of a PID controller. The cooling load in the cold store is emulated by means of 
additional electrical heaters wired to a volt age regulator. To keep the air temperature 
reasonably constant in the cold store, an on/off refrigeration control system has been 
implemented. This is done by turning on/off the compressor and the fan of the heat 
exchangers. 
Table 6 reports the transducers specifications used (Coriolis effect mass flow rate meter, 
RTD 100 4 wires thermo-resistances, piezoelectri c absolute pressure gauge, wattmeter). The 
thermo-resistances are located outside the pipe , with a layer of heat transfer compound 
(aluminum oxide plus silicon) placed between th e sensor and the pipe in order to provide 
good thermal contact. The whole pipe is covered with 25 mm thick flexible insulation. The 
system of temperature measurem ent was checked against a sensor  positioned in pocket in a 
similarly insulated pipe work. For various te st conditions, the difference between the two 
measurements has been always less than 0. 3 °C. The wattmeter is able to measure the 
electrical power absorbed by the compressor,  t h e  b l o w e r s  a n d  a n y  k i n d  o f  a c c e s s o r y  
installed for operation of the device. The energy consumption of the refrigeration system is 
measured by means of an energy meter. The test apparatus is equipped with 32 bit A/D 
converter acquisition cards linked to a personal computer that allows a high sampling rate 
(10 kHz)

4.3. Experimental procedure 
We started the experimental investigation by an alyzing the operation of the plant with R22. 
Subsequently, we retrofitted th e refrigeration system with R422D in accordance with [31]. 
During the retrofitting operations, we changed the factory setting of the R22 thermostatic 
expansion valve in order to keep the operat ing superheat value for R422D in the same 
range used for R22, which was performed by turning the adjusting screw of the valve.  
For both refrigerants, we used the same experi mental procedure. Firstly, we proceeded with 
identifying the refrigerant charge necessary to guarantee that the fluid adequately wets the 
evaporator. For this purpose, we set the temperatu re of the air blown through the condenser to 
24°C and the air inner to cold store to -5°C, whil e the cooling load was kept at 1000 W. By means 
of a vacuum pump, we evacuated the circuit, and then we proceeded with introducing 0.40 kg of 
gas in the refrigerant circuit whil e the system was shut off to prese rve the electrical motor of the 
compressor from overheating. Subsequently, we turned on the plant and the electrical heaters 
inside the cold store. During the operation of th e plant, we monitored th e value of the operating 
superheat, defined as the difference between th e temperature at end of the evaporating process 
(considering the pressure drop into the evaporat or) and temperature at the compressor inlet. 
Then, we systematically continued: additional 0. 10 kg of refrigerant was introduced until, under 
steady state conditions, the operating superheat was not included in the range 7.0 – 10 °C.

Once the system was charged to the specified va lue we proceeded with the evaluation of the 
energy consumption due to a year of operatio n (storage investigation). Usually, the service 
life (V) of refrigeration system refers to the operation time of the equipment. If one is 
investigating the change of the environmental im pact due to the retrofitting operations, the 
service life to use for the comparing analysis should not be equal to the actual life of the 
equipment, but one has to consider a referenc e service life. In this paper the reference 
service life is one year. In this scenario, the leakage rate per year has not to include the 
disposal percentage but only the accidental percentage due to operating conditions. Table 7 
reports the parameters for TEWI evaluation according to eq.(1). 
In particular, we investigated four different  s t o r a g e  a p p l i c a t i o n s :  - 5 ,  0 ,  5 ,  1 0 ° C .  W e  
considered as external air temperature refere nce the values reported in Table 8, which 
represent typical conditions in Milan, Italy, used for our scenario.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 68 
Since this table provides the daily change of external air temperature for each month, we 
planned 12 experiments each 24 hours long. The data reported in Table 8 were loaded as 
database for the PID controller, which modulates the voltage supply to the electrical 
resistances used to warm the air intake. Fo r each experiment, recording of the energy 
consumption values started when the refrigeration control began to operate. 
To evaluate the energetic perfor mance, we needed further expe riments aimed to analyze the 
behavior of the plant under steady state conditions ( performance investigation ). For this 
purpose, we planned 4 experiments at different storage temperatures: -5, 0, 5, 10°C. During 
the experiments, we shunted the refrigeration control and we set the temperature of the air 
blown through the condenser to a reference valu e. We choose as reference the mean of the 
data reported in Table 8: 21 °C. Usually, the start-up time required was about one hour. 
Steady state conditions were assumed to hold when the deviations of all controlled variables 
from their corresponding mean values were lo wer than 0.5°C for temperatures and 15 kPa for 
pressures. At this stage, the test started and the logging of data with 0.5 Hz acquisition 
frequency was performed on all channels for 60 s. For each channel, the 120 samples recorded 
were averaged. After 180 s, each sample duri ng 60 s was checked against the corresponding 
mean values of the two previous samples; when  the mean values of the temperatures and of 
the pressures were within the range reported  above, the steady state was reached.

4.4. Data elaboration 
To manage the large number of data, we developed a software application called 
FrigoCheck v.1.0. It is able to show in real time the coefficient of performance, the entropy 
and the enthalpy values of all points of the thermodynamic cycl e. In addition, it shows the 
whole cycle on p-h diagram and it establishes th e achievement of the steady state condition.  
Since we measured the daily energy consumptio n for each month (Ed,i), we calculated the 
monthly energy consumption (Em,i) by  means of the following equation 
 m,i d,i iEE N D  u  ( 2 )  
where the subscript i refers to the generic month and ND is equal to the number of days for 
the i-th month. We obtained yearlong energy consumption (E) by summing the monthly 
energy consumptions (E m,i):

4.5. Scenario and sensitivity analysis for the TEWI difference 
Once completed the experimental investigation and the data elaboration, we focused our 
attention on the following question: after the re trofitting operations, how can one reduce the 
R422D TEWI? For this purpose, we considered a scenario and sensitivity analysis for the 
TEWI difference aimed to individuate the oper ating conditions (scenario) leading to the 
reduction of the TEWI. In equation (1), we individuated two parameters: 
x Leakage rate per year, which acts on the direct effect;  
x Energy saving, which acts on  the indirect effect.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 70 
For our first analysis, we kept the yearlong energy consumptions equal to those measured 
and varied the leakage rate pe r year, in accordance with th e range 5-10%. For each leakage 
rate value, we calculated the new R422D TE WI and compared it with the R22 TEWI by 
means of the following equation: 
 R422D R22
R22TEWI TEWİTEWI .TEWI . (6) 
We repeated this procedure for each test condit ion; therefore we obtained the change of the 
TEWI difference as a function of  the leakage. As a second anal ysis, we kept the leakage rate 
equal to that reported in Table 7 and we va ried the yearlong energy consumptions by 
considering an energy saving included in the range 0-100%. Following a similar procedure 
to that above mentioned, we obtained the ch ange of the TEWI difference at each test 
conditions as a function of the energy saving.  
Since the one parameter analysis could lead to scenarios technically not feasible or very 
expensive, we deemed appropriate to consider the simultaneous change of both parameters.  
4.6. Results and discussions 
The first step of the experimental investigation led to identifying the correct charge for both 
refrigerants. As reported in Table 7, from ex perimental evaluation, the mass of R22 resulted 
0.20 kg larger than that of R422D, which me ans an 8% reduction of refrigerant mass.  
By means of the storage inve stigation we carried out the daily energy consumptions (E d,i) for 
each test conditions (Table 9).

Table 9.  Daily energy consumption measured. The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 71 
Considering equation (2) we converted the results shown in Table 9 in monthly energy 
consumptions (E m,i) and then in yearlong ener gy consumptions (Fig. 19).  
It can be seen that the yearlong  energy consumption pertaining to R422D is larger than that of 
R22 (7.10-28.9%) for each test conditions. Fu rthermore, for both refrigerants the energy 
consumption diminishes with the increase of th e air temperature inner cold store. This is 
easily understandable if one considers the reduction of the operating temperature span, 
which is defined as the mean difference between the hot thermal sink (external ambient) and 
the cold thermal sink (cold store).

Table 10.  Monthly energy consumption calculated by means of the Eq. 2 
In Fig. 20, for both refrigerants we have drawn the TEWI relative to one year of operation as 
function of the air temperature i nner to cold store. Since the first term of the equation (1) is 
constant for both refrigerants and for each test condition, it is noticeable that the change of 
TEWI is directly influenced by that of the energy consumption. 
 
Figure 21.  Difference percentage of indirect, direct and TE WI vs. air temperature inner to cold store. 
As remarked in Fig.21, the ad option of R422D leads to a wo rsening of the environmental 
impact. Because the GWP of R422D  i s  5 0 %  h i g h e r  t h a n  t h a t  o f  R 2 2 ,  t h e  8 %  r e d u c t i o n  o f  
refrigerant mass does not impact significantly the decrease of the direct effect of R422D, 
which results equal to 42% higher than that of R22. The indirect effect (Fig. 21) of R422D is 
higher than that of R22; in pa rticular, this difference grows wi th the increase of the storage

Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 73 
temperature. Consequently, the release of CO 2, due to the adoption of R422D, grows from a 
minimum of 7.1% to a maximum of 28.9%. 
The augmentation of the energy consumption has been also confirmed by performance 
investigation. In Fig. 22, we report both the change of the COP and that of the efficiency as a 
function of the air temperature inner to cold store. The results there illustrated highlights a 
lower efficiency of the plant due to the adoption of R422D. It is  possible to observe that COP 
increases with the increase of the air temperature inner to cold store and that the COP for 
R22 is higher than for R422D. 
In particular, the difference between the COP fo r R22 and that for R422D is, on average, 20% 
and it increases with the increa se of the air temperature inner cold store. The worsening of 
the energy performance, due to the use of R422D as substitute of R22,  is remarked by the 
efficiency values sh owed in Fig. 22.  
 
Figure 22.  COP and efficiency of the plant vs. air te mperature inner to cold store (±2.5%). 
The lower R422D efficiency values represent a warning on the ineffi ciency of the plant 
subsequent to the retrofitting operations. During the performance investigation, we 
observed a substantially different behavior of  t h e  c o n d e n s e r .  A s  r e p o r t e d  i n  F i g .  2 3  t h e  
condensing pressure of R422D was higher than that of R22, while the evaporating pressure 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 74 
for both refrigerants was similar. This gain in terms of pressure at condenser shows that, 
when R422D is used as refriger ant, the heat exchange surface of the condenser is insufficient 
to reject the thermal power. Furthermore, a more high condensing pressure leads to an 
increase of electrical power absorbed by  t h e  c o m p r e s s o r  f u r t h e r  r e d u c i n g  t h e  C O P .  
However, it is our interest to understand how to improve the energy performance of the 
plant operating with R422D, wi th the intent of reducing the indirect impact on the 
environment. Particular attention should be gi ven to the condenser, since, as highlighted 
above, the heat exchange surface required by  R 2 2  i s  l e s s  t h a n  t h a t  r e q u i r e d  b y  R 4 2 2 .  
Referring to the operation with  R422D, an improvemen t of the heat exchange at condenser 
could lead to reduce the condensing pressure , and then the specific  w o r k  o f  c o m p r e s s o r .  
Furthermore, the fluid leaving the condenser would be sub-cooled further, allowing a gain 
of the specific heat of evaporation. Conseque ntly, a lower mass flow rate could be required, 
and then the power absorbed by the comp ressor could be reduce d, guarantying an 
improvement of the COP. 
 
Figure 23.  Condensing and evaporating pressure vs. air temperature inner to cold store. 
The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 75 
To enhance the heat exchange at cond enser two methods could be considered: 
x if the blower have different operating sp eeds, select the highest speed available, 
otherwise, change the blow er with another having hi gher volumetric capacity; 
x replace the condenser with on e having a larger surface. 
It is important to underline that the first so lution is better than se cond, since cheaper and 
technically easier, but it could lead to a larger  a b s o r p t i o n  o f  e l e c t r i c a l  p o w e r  b y  b l o w e r s ,  
negatively affecting the COP. Base d on theoretical considerations [32], it is possible to expect 
a 15% increase of COP for a 1.5 bar re duction of the condensing pressure. 
When R422D is used as refrigerant, a further improvement of the energy  
performance could be obtained by installing  a n  e l e c t r o n i c  e x p a n s i o n  v a l v e  i n s t e a d  o f  
the thermostatic one. As showed by Lazzari n and Noro [33], for any refrigerants the 
electronic expansion valve allows a lower condensation pressure in systems equipped 
with air-cooled condensers, thanks to the ability of monitoring the variations of 
theoutside air temperature. Consequently, th ey [33] indicated, on average, an 8% 
reducing of energy consumption for Medi terranean locations and a 15% for North-
European locations.  
Once completed the experimental investigation, we considered a new scenario still to 
evaluated a sensitivity analysis for the TEWI difference, now aimed to highlight the way to 
reduce the environmental impact of the R22 retrofit with R422D. For this purpose, we have 
reported in Fig. 24 the change of the TEWI difference percentage  as a function of the leakage 
rate per year, while in Fig.25 we have done it as a function of the energy saving per year. For 
both figures, we have iden tified three scenarios:  
x Scenario A: it represents the parameter doma in, for which for every test conditions the 
environmental impact for R422D become s higher than that for R22.   
x Scenario B: it represents the parameter doma in of transition, for which at least for  
one test condition the enviro nmental impact for R422D be comes lower than that for 
R22.   
x Scenario C (or eco-friendly scenario): it represents the parameter domain, for which for 
every test conditions the environmental impa ct for R422D becomes lower than that for 
R22.   
Furthermore, we reported two dashed axes, whose intersection repr esents the breakeven 
point between the TEWI of R22 an d that of R422D for all test conditions. Fig. 24 shows that 
for leakage rate per year lower than 5.7% the TEWI of R422D becomes lower than that of 
R22. The scenario B is very narrow and this allows achieving of the breakeven point almost 
simultaneously for all operating conditions. Considering 5% as technical limit for no-
hermetical plant, it can see that the scenario  C  ( F i g .  2 4 )  o c c u r s  f o r  l e a k a g e  r a t e  p e r  y e a r  
values including in the narrowest range 5.0 ÷ 5.4 %, and it leads to a maximum ̇TEWI 
(absolute value) included between -6.0 ÷ -2.0%. The scenario C is technically feasible but it 
leads to an increase of the management costs:  l e a k a g e  c h e c k  m o r e  f r e q u e n t  c o u l d  l e a d  t o  
reduce the leakage rate, as  indicated in [34].    
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 76 
Considering the change of the en ergy saving (Fig. 25), it can be seen that the scenario B is 
very large and it starts for ~20% energy savi ng; the breakeven point is reachable for ~70% 
energy saving. These results are not reassuri ng, because a 70% ener gy saving should 
correspond to a plant efficiency equal to 30% , when usually, for ac tual plant operating 
under the same conditions here investigated, th e efficiency can be equal to 25%. Differently, 
as above mentioned, 20% energy saving could be  o b t a i n e d  a s  a  r e s u l t  b o t h  o f  t h e  h e a t  
exchange improvement and of the use of electr onic expansion valves. Since both the strong 
reduction of leakage rate and the high energy saving lead to an increase of the total cost of 
the retrofitting operations, it is necessary to consider an ov erlay parameter change. For this 
purpose, we have developed another scenario considering the simultaneous change of both 
parameters. 
In Fig. 26 we have reported four different charts , each referring to different test condition in 
terms of air temperature inner to cold store. For each chart, we have drawn a solid black 
line, which identifies the bord er between the scenario characterized by a negative TEWI 
difference (eco-friendly scenario) and that by a positive TEWI difference. This time the eco-
friendly scenario is identified by means of a 2 D domain (leakage rate & energy saving): one 
has to select one couple of values for leakag e rate and energy saving per year in order to 
obtain a reduction of TEWI consequently to th e adoption of R422D. That the overlaying of 
the effects allows obtaining strong TEWI reduction by means of cheap operations: minor 
reductions of leakage rate an d energy saving are required.

4.7. Concluding remarks 
An experimental investigation has been carrie d out study the environmental impact of the 
R22 retrofit with R422D and to draw possible eco-friendly scenarios [35]. The experimental 
investigation consisted of two parts:  
x Storage investigation, aimed at developing of TEWI analysis.  
x Performance investigation, aimed at analyzin g the behavior of the plant under steady 
state conditions. 
For both investigations, we have considered four operating conditions in terms of the air 
temperature inner to cold store: -5, 0, 5, 10° C. To emulate actual op erating conditions we 
choose Milan as reference locality.  
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 78 
 
Figure 26.  Operating scenario charts a) at -5°C, b) at 0 °C, c) 5°C and d) 10°C. 
Subsequently, a scenario and sensitivity analysis for the TEWI difference has been 
introduced to study ways of reducing the environmental impact of the R22 retrofit with 
R422D. For this purpose leakage rate and improved efficiency have been considered as 
parameters and three parametric analyses have been developed: two have been carried 
out by changing only one parameter per time, while the other one by changing 
simultaneously both parameters. Based on our investigation, we can draw the following 
conclusions:  
1. The storage investigation have demonstrated that for each test conditions the R22 
retrofit with R422D leads to  a n  i n c r e a s e  o f  t h e  e n e r g y  c o n s u m p t i o n  u p  t o  2 8 . 9 %  
worsening CO 2 emissions. 
The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 79 
2. Since the GWP of R422D is much higher than that of R22 and even if the charge of 
R422D is 8% lower than that of R22, the dire ct effect of the R422D is 42% higher than 
that of R22. 
3. As a consequence of the R22 retrofit with R422D, the plant investigated has shown an 
increase of TEWI up to 36.8 %. 
4. The performance investigation highlighted that the operation with R422D is less 
efficient than that with R22. In particul ar, the difference between the COP for R22 and 
that for R422D is, on average,  20%, and it grows with the ra ising of the air temperature 
of the inner cold store.  
5. R22 retrofit with R422D leads to an increase of the conden sing pressure, which indicates 
that the heat exchange surface of the cond enser is insufficient to  r e j e c t  t h e  t h e r m a l  
power, worsening the efficiency.  
6. To improve the energy performance and then to  reduce the indirect effect, we proposed 
two ways: improving of the heat exchange su rface and adoption of electronic expansion 
valves. Based on theoretical considerations it is possible to obtain a 20% reduction of 
energy consumption.  
7. The scenario and sensitivity analysis for the TEWI difference have demonstrated 
that for each test condition there are some operating eco-friendly scenarios. In 
particular, if the parameters change simult aneously, the eco-friendly scenario results 
technically feasible: both lower reductions  of leakage rate and lower energy saving 
are required.

substitution with R744 
5.1. R134a substitution with R744 
In the field of the mobile refrigeration syst ems, the European Parliament already set a 
regulation of F-Gases phase out that bans th e use of refrigerants having GWPs exceeding 
150. Such regulation is in effect since 2011. 
R134a is an HFC with zero ODP and a GWP of 1300. According to the above mentioned 
European regulation on F-Gases, the use of R 134a will be banned in mo bile systems. R744 is 
a natural fluid (CO 2) therefore with no ODP and negligib le direct contribution to global 
warming and can be a substitute of R134a. In this study, the im pact of the substitution of 
R134a with R744 on global warming was studie d through experimental  evaluations of the 
TEWI index under different operating conditions. 
The experimental tests discussed in this study compare a commercial R134a refrigeration 
plant subjected to a cold store and a protot ype R744 system working as a classical spit-
system to cool air in a trans-critical cycle.  
Table 11 reports the parameters adopted for the TEWI evaluation. The annual operating 
hours in the TEWI simulation are 8760. These correspond to a commercial refrigerator cold 
store according to Dir.94/2/CE [36].

Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 81 
Basically, there are two single-stage hermetic re ciprocating compressors, an oil separator, an 
air gas-cooler, a liquid capacity, an air evaporator, an electronic expansion valve (EEV) and 
an electronically-regulated ba ck pressure valve (BPV). The main compressor is a semi-
hermetic one. At evaporation temperatures of 5°C and of 30°C at the gas-cooler exit, when 
the pressure is 80 bar, the refrigerating powe r is about 3000W. An in ternal heat exchanger 
(IHX) between the refrigerant fl ow at the compressor suction and at the exit of the gas-
cooler is provided. The lamination occurs th anks to the back-pressu re valve and to the 
electronic expansion one. An auxiliary circuit can be used to by-pass the back-pressure 
valve, in order to vary the evaporation temper ature. The air temperature on the condenser is 
regulated by an air-flow driven by a blower in a thermally insulated channel. Its 
temperature is modulated by some electrical re sistances. This simula tes variable external 
conditions, as well. 
The plant is fully instrumented, in order to eval uate its performance as a whole, as well as 
that of each single component.  The pressure and the temperat ure of the carbon dioxide are 
measured both at the inlet and at the outlet of  each device. Mass flow rate is monitored at 
the main compressor suction (see Figure 27). Tw o watt transducers are used to measure the 
electrical power supplied to the compressors. Table 12 summarizes all the characteristics of 
the plant instrumentation.

The Coefficient of Performance is evaluated with eq. (4), with un certainty of + 3.8 %

The uncertainty of the TEWI was calculated by applying the e rror propagation theory to Eq. 
(1). A balance is used to measure the refrigeran t charge with an uncertainty of + 0.2% in the 
range 0-100 kg. Sand et al. [18] suggested that  a minimum of 20% unce rtainty exists for the 
GWP values assigned to refrig erants by the Intergovernmen tal Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC). These uncertainties, when combined with other estimates and assumptions of the 
analysis lead to a TEWI uncertainty of 10%.  
5.2.2. Refrigeration plant working with R134a 
The experimental vapour compression plant,  s u b j e c t e d  t o  a  c o m m e r c i a l l y  a v a i l a b l e   
cold store and reported in Figure 28, is made up of a semi-hermetic reciprocating 
compressor.

Figure 28.  Sketch of the R134a experimental plant. 
It was designed for the fluid R134a, according to the manufacturer sp ecifications. The plant 
is supplied with a three-phase current (380 V phase-phase), an air condenser followed by a 
liquid receiver, a manifold with two expansion valves, a thermostatic one and a manual one 
mounted in parallel, to feed an air cooling evaporator inside the cold store.  
In the evaporation temperature range -20 y10°C with a 35°C condensing temperature, 
working with the R134a at the nominal freque ncy of 50Hz, the compressor refrigerating 
capacity varies in the range 1.4 y4.4 kW.  A blower provides an air -flow within a thermally 
insulated channel where some el ectrical resistances are located. Their power-modulation 
enables the control of the air temperature on the condenser and simulates different external 
conditions. 
The refrigeration duty in the cold store is simulated by means of regulated electrical 
resistances. The electric power is measur ed by means of a watt transducer whose 
specifications are reported in Table 13.  
Further specifications of the experimental plan t were reported in a previous work [38-41]. 
The COP values calculated in accordance with (7), should be considered with an uncertainty 
less than ±0.5%. The sma ller accuracy in the calculus of th e COP pertaining to the R744 plant 
is due to a different accuracy of  the pressure gauges used for the R744, as compared to those 
used for the R134. The lower accuracy of the pressure gauges for th e R744 stems from the 
larger measurement range required.

5.3. Results and discussion 
The experimental, R744 plant was optimized in order to maximize its energetic 
performance.  
The direct contribution to glob al warming was evaluated on the basis of the measured plant 
charge. The R744 charge is the optimal one, corresponding to 6.87 kg. That for R134a is of 
2.45 kg. The direct cont ribution to the greenhouse effect  p e r t a i n i n g  t o  R 1 3 4 a  d u r i n g  t h e  
plant useful life is always grea ter that that pertaining to R 744. The direct contribution of 
R744 is negligible respect to the indirect one, whereas that of R134a is comparable. 
System performances are compared for two evaporation temperatures of 0 and 5 °C, 
respectively, by varying the temperature of th e external air over th e gas-cooler and the 
condenser. Both plants develop a refrigerant power of 3000 W. 
In the evaluation of the total contribution to greenhouse effect, three scenarios were 
considered: a commercial refrigerator cold st ore, a classical split-system and a mobile 
refrigeration system. 
In the first scenario a commercial refrigerat ion cold store was considered. According to 
Dir.94/2/CE, it works for 8760 annual operating hours. 
Figure 29 reports TEWI as a function of ex ternal air temperature for an evaporating 
temperature of 0 and 5 °C, respec tively. Figure clearly shows that , for both refrigerant fluids, 
TEWI increases with the external air te mperature because of the COP decrease. 
Indeed, COP decreases due to the decrease of the refriger ant fluid enthalpy at the 
evaporator inlet because of the pr essure increase at the condenser/gas-cooler. Its rise leads to 
a higher enthalpy at the compressor outlet , thus increasing th e specific work of 
compression. The COP decrease for R744 is more marked than that of R134a.  
The performance of both refrigerant fluids at fixed external air temperature decreases with 
evaporating temperature. This effect is mo re marked for the plant working with the 
transcritical cycle. In a typica l transcritical cycle the expans ion valve provides a dominant 
contribution to the overall energy loss [42,43].  Th e irrever sibil ity  of  th e ex pan sion  process 
increases by decreasing the evaporating pressure  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 84 
Figure 29 clearly shows that, for a refrigerating system working as a co mmercial refrigerator 
cold store, the TEWI pertaining to R134a is al ways lower than that of R744 from a minimum 
of -22% to a maximum of -73%. The higher indi rect contribution to global warming of R744 
with respect to R134a always prevails. 
The second scenario is a clas sical split-system, that accord ing to Dir.29/1/2003 works with 
500 annual operating hours. 
Figure 30 reports TEWI as a function of ex ternal air temperature for an evaporating 
temperature of 0 and 5 °C.

In this case TEWI of R134a is  higher than that of R 744 for external air  temperature of 25 
and 30 °C (from a minimum of 3 to maximum of 16%). In these experimental conditions the 
system working with R744 has a lower global  w arm in g  i m pact a s com p ared t o a sy s tem  
with R134a. This effect is due to the lower dire ct contribution of R744 that prevails on the 
indirect one. In the operating conditions co rresponding to external air temperature of 35 
and 40 °C, the TEWI of R134a is lower that that of R744 (from a minimum of -4 to 
maximum of -25%). 
The third scenario is a mobile refrigeration system 
In the following analysis, a 1000 kg small commerc ial car was considered. For this car, 98 g 
of CO 2 are released per km [46] in a typical urba n cycle with a mean engine power of 5 kW. 
On this basis, the fraction of CO 2 emission produced by a 3 kW  a i r  c o n d i t i o n i n g  d e v i c e  
employing R134a was evaluated. The R 134a charge is 800 g. That of CO 2 is 1.20 kg. 
From these data and from the previous experiment al results, it is possible to evaluate the 
TEWI for both R134a and R744.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 86 
In figure 31 TEWI is reported as a function  of the refrigerant le akage rate per year.  
The figure clearly shows that TEWI of R134a is lower than that of R744 (from a minimum of 
-4.7 to a maximum of -22%) in the yearly refr igerant leakage rate of 5 and 20%, respectively. 
At 25% the two fluids show the same TEWI. On the contrary, at 30% leakage, the R134a 
TEWI exceeds that of R744 of +4%. 
In a typical mobile air conditioning device, the yearly refrigerant leakage rate is around  
25%.

5.4. Concluding remarks 
The substitution of R134a was analyzed in te rms of global warming effect. Indeed, R134a 
will be banned in mobile systems, according to the regulation on F-Gases. R134a has a 
relevant direct global warmin g effect stemming from its absorption power of long-wave 
radiations, that depends on its GWP and on the fraction of refr igerant charge released into The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 87 
the atmosphere. A possible substitute of R134a could be carbon dioxide, i.e. a natural fluid 
with negligible direct contribution to global warming.  
An experimental comparison between R134a an d R744 was performed in terms of the total 
equivalent warming impact (TEWI) that combin es the effect of the direct emissions of 
refrigerants with the indirect effect of energy consumption. 
The experiments compare a commercial R134a refr igeration plant subjected to a cold store 
and a prototype R744 system work ing in a trans-critical cycle.  A preliminary analysis was 
carried out, in order to maximize the energeti c performance of the trans-critical cycle.  
In the comparison, different, common working conditions were considered by varying the 
external temperature and that of the evapor ation. In all the test runs, the energetic 
efficiency of the trans-critical cycle is alwa ys lower than that of the plant working with 
R134a. This leads to a greater indirect global  w a r m i n g  e f f e c t  o f  t h e  p l a n t  w o r k i n g  w i t h  
R744. 
Three different scenarios were considered: a co mmercial refrigerator cold store, a classical 
split-system and a mobile refrigeration system. 
Based on our investigation, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1) For a refrigerating system working as a commercial refrigerator cold store at fixed 
refrigerant leakage rate per year (5%), the TE WI pertaining to R134a is always lower than 
that of R744 by a minimum of -22% up to a maximum of -73%.  
2) A refrigerating system workin g as a classical split (at fixed 5% refrigerant leakage rate per 
year) with R134a has a greater global warming impact as compared to a system with R134a 
for external air temperature of 25 and 30 °C (from a minimum of 3 to maximum of 16%). 
Whereas, in the operating conditions correspon ding to external air temperature of 35 and  
40 °C, the TEWI of R134a is lower that that of R744 (from a minimum of -4 to maximum  
of -25%). 
3) In a mobile refrigeration system, the TEWI of R134a is lower than that of R744 (from a 
minimum of -4.7 to a maximum of -22%) for yearly refrigerant leakage rates between 5 and 
20%. At 25% leakage, the two fl uids show the same TEWI, wh ereas, at 30% leakage, the 
R134a TEWI exceeds that of R744 by +4%. In view of these results, R744 does not appear to 
be a suitable substitute for R 134a. The latter, however, must be  ruled out in mobile systems, 
in any case. Therefore, alternative fluids su ch as HFO (HydroFluoro-Olefin) should be 
considered. 
6. Conclusions and recommendations 
The impact of vapour compressi on refrigerant fluids on global warming has been analyzed 
by means of an experimental study. Vapour co mpression plants have both a direct and an 
indirect contribution to global warming. The Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) 
index takes into account both the direct and indirect contribution to global warming.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 88 
In this chapter the su bstitution of R22 and R134a has been studied. R407C and R422D are 
possible substitutes for R22. R22 is an HCFC, with an ODP of  0.05 and a GWP of 1700. Both 
refrigerant fluids are drop in  substitutes: R407C is an HFC with zero ODP and a GWP 6% 
lower than that of R22, R422D is an HFC with zero ODP and a GWP 31% greater than that of 
R22. R134a is a single hydrofluorocarbon (HFC ) compound. It has no chlorine content and 
therefore no ozone depletion potential, and a GWP R134a of 1300.  
In the field of mobile refrig eration systems, the European Parliament (EU 842/2006) already 
set F-Gases phase out regulation that bans the us e of refrigerants having GWPs in excess of 
150. According to this regulation the use of R134a will be banned in mobile systems. Pure 
CO 2 ( R 7 4 4 ) ,  w i t h  n o  d i r e c t  c o n t r i b u t i o n  t o  g l o b al warming, can be a substitute of R134a. 
Experimental tests have been carried out on different vapour compression pilot plants for a 
range of operating conditions, the prototype R744 system works in a trans-critical cycle 
From the experimental analysis the following general conclusions can be drawn: 
x R22 direct contribution to the greenhouse effect  is greater than that pertaining to R407C 
(+15%). The COP corresponding to  R407C is 3.3-19% lower than that pertaining to R22. 
x In the experimental tests corresponding to a condensation temperature in the range 43 / 
47 °C and to an evaporation temperature in the range -12 / -7 °C, the TEWI pertaining to 
R407C exceeds that of R22 by about 11%. Therefore, the subs titution of R22 with R407C 
should be unacceptable if specific reference is made to the greenhouse effect. 
x In the experimental tests corresponding to  a  c o n d e n s a t i o n  t e m p e r a t u r e  i n  t h e  r a n g e  
53/58 °C and to an evaporation temperature inlet range 2 / 10 °C, R22 and R407C behave 
in a similar way as rega rds the greenhouse effect. 
x For high evaporation and condensation (over 50°C) temperatures, the TEWI of R407C is 
slightly lower than that of R22. As a conseq uence, the substitution of R22 with R407C is 
favourable, since no harm is produced to  t h e  o z o n e  l a y e r  a n d  n o  i n c r e a s e  i n  C O 2 
emission is made.  
x GWP of R422D is much higher than that of R22 and even if the charge of R422D is 8% 
lower than that of R22, the di rect effect of the R422D is 42%  higher than that of R22. 
x The plant working with R422D is less efficien t than that with R22.  I n  p a r t i c u l a r ,  t h e  
difference between the COP for R22 and that  f o r  R 4 2 2 D  i s ,  o n  a v e r a g e ,  2 0 % ,  a n d  i t  
grows with the raising of the air temp erature of the inner cold store.  
x For each test conditions the R22 retrofit with  R422D leads to an increase of the energy 
consumption up to 28.9% , worsening CO 2 emissions, with an increase of TEWI up to 
36.8 %. Therefore the substituti on of R22 with R422D is al ways unacceptable from the 
point of view of greenhouse effect. 
x In all the test runs, the energe tic efficiency of the trans-critical cycle is always lower 
than that of the plant working with R134a. This leads to a greater indirect global 
warming effect of the pl ant working with R744. 
x For a refrigerating system working as a commercial refrigerator cold store the 
substitution of R134a with R744 is always unacceptable beca use the TEWI pertaining to 
R134a is always lower than that of  R744 (from -22% to -73%).  The Impact on Global Warming of the Substitution of  
Refrigerant Fluids in Vapour Compressi on Plants: An Experimental Study 89 
x A refrigerating system workin g as a classical split with R134a has a greater global 
warming impact as compared to a system with R744 for ex ternal air temperature of 25 
and 30 °C (from a minimum of 3 to maximu m of 16%). Whereas, in the operating 
conditions corresponding to external air temperature of 35 and 40 °C, the TEWI of 
R134a is lower that that of  R744 (from a minimum of -4 to maximum of -25%). 
x In a mobile refrigeration system, the TEWI of R134a is lower than that of R744 (from a 
minimum of -4.7 to a maximum of -22%) for yearly refrigerant le akage rates between 5 
and 20%. At 25% leakage, the tw o fluids show the same TEWI , whereas, at 30% leakage, 
the R134a TEWI exceeds that of R744 by +4%. In view of these results, R744 does not 
appear to be a suitable substitute for R134a.

1. Introduction 
Global warming and climate change refer to an  increase in average global temperatures. 
Natural events and human activities are believed to be main contributors to such increases 
in average global temperatures. The climate ch ange, caused by rising emissions of carbon 
dioxide from vehicles, factories and power stations, will not only effects the atmosphere and 
the sea but also will alter the geology of the Earth. Emissions of carbon dioxide due to our 
use of fossil energy will change the climate and th e temperature is estimated to increase by 2 
to 6o Celsius within year 2100, which is a trem endous increase from our current average 
temperature of 1.7o Celsius as predicted by IPCC. This may cause huge changes to our 
civilization, both positive and negative, but the total impact on our society is currently very 
uncertain. Forecasts indicate that major storms could devastate New York City in next 
decade whereas Gulf countries will get affected badly well before. 
Global warming primarily caused by increase s in “greenhouse” gases such as Carbon 
Dioxide (CO 2), Nitrous oxide (NO X), Sulphur dioxide (SO 2), Hydrogen etc., . A warming 
planet thus leads to climate changes which ca n adversely affect weather in different ways. 
Some of the prominent indicators for a global warming are detailed below: 
i. Temperature over land 
ii. Snow cover on Hills 
iii. Glaciers on Hills 
iv. Ocean Heat content 
v. Sea Ice 
vi. Sea level 
vii. Sea surface temperature

Past decade, according to Scientists in 48 Countries, it was recorded warmest time phase 
during meeting of ȱNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA), on July 28, 2010. 
Although since decades, scientists and envi ronmentalists have been warning that the way 
we are using Earth’s resources is not sustainable. Alternative technologies have been called 
for repeatedly, seemingly falling upon deaf ears  or, cynically, upon those who don’t want to 
make substantial changes as it challenge their bottom line and reduces their current profits. 
Global warming in today’s scenario  is threat  to the survival of mankind.  In 1956, an US 
based Chief consultant and oil geologist Marion King Hubert, (1956)  predicted  that if oil is 
consumed with high rate, US oil production ma y peak in 1970 and thereafter it will decline. 
He also described that other countries may a ttain peak oil day within 20-30 years and many 
more may suffer with oil crises within 40 years, when oil wells are going to dry. He 
illustrated the projection with a bell shaped Hubert Curve  based on the availability and its 
consumptions of the fossil fuel. Large fields are discovered first, sm all ones later. After 
exploration and initial growth in output, prod uction plateaus and ev entually declines to 
zero.  
Crude oil, coal and gas are the main resources for world energy supply. The size of fossil 
fuel reserves and the dilemma that when non-renewable energy will be diminished, is a 
fundamental and doubtful question that needs to be answered. A new formula for 
calculating, when fossil fuel reserves are likely  to be dep leted , i s prese n ted along wit h  an 
econometrics model to demonstrate the relation ship between fossil fuel reserves and some 
main variables (Shahriar Shafiee et.al. 2009). The new formula is modified from the Klass 
model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve 
depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approx imately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This 
means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only  fossil fuel remaining 
after 2042.  
In India, vehicular pollution is estimated to have increased eight times over the last two 
decades. This source alone is estimated to contribute about 70 per cent to the total air 
pollution. With 243.3 million tons of carbon re leased from the consumption and combustion 
of fossil fuels in 1999, India is ranked fifth in  the world behind the U.S., China, Russia and 
Japan. India's contribution to world carbon emi ssions is expected to increase in the coming 
years due to the rapid pace of urbanization, shift from non-commercial to commercial fuels, 
increased vehicular usage and continued use of  o l d e r  a n d  m o r e  i n e f f i c i e n t  c o a l - f i r e d  a n d  
fuel power-plants ( Singh, BR, et al., 2010 ). 
Thus, peak oil year may be the turning point for mankind which may lead to the end of 100 
year of easy growth, if self-sufficiently and sustainability of energy is not maintained on 
priority. This chapter describes the efforts be ing made to explore non-conventional energy 
resources such as: solar energy, wind energy, bio-mass and bio-gas, hydrogen, bio-diesel 
which may help for the sustainable fossil fuel reserves and reduce the tail pipe emission and

2. Weather watch: Byron's view of the glaciers 
In September 1816, Lord Byron set off from Gene va with his friend Hob house, and kept a 
journal for his half-sister Augusta. Lodged at th e Curate's, set out to see the Valley; heard an 
Avalanche fall, like thunder; saw Glacier – en ormous. Storm came on, thunder, lightning, 
hail; all in perfection, and beautiful ( Fig 1 ). 
 
Figure 1.  Byron described glaciers in Geneva as "neither mist nor water" in September 1816. 
(Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP) 
He said that he was on horsebac k; Guide wanted to carry his cane ; he was going to give it to 
him, when he recollected that it was a Sw ordstick, and he thought lightning might be 
attracted towards him; kept it himself; a good deal encumbered with it, and his cloak, as it 
was too heavy for a whip, and the horse was stup id, and stood still with every other peal," 
he records in Byron: Selections from Po etry, Letters & Journals (Nonesuch Press.) 
Got in, not very wet; the cloak being staunch, H wet though. H took refuge in a cottage; sent 
man, umbrella and cloak (from the Curate's when  he arrived) after him. He sees a torrent 
like the tail of a white horse streaming in the wind, such as it might be conceived would be 
that of the ' pale horse' on which Death  is mounted in the Apocalypse. It is neither mist nor 
water, but something between both; its immense height (nine hundred feet) gives it a wave,

a curve, a spreading here, a condensation there, wonderful and indescribable. He looks 
again the next day: the Sun upon it forming a rainbow of the lower part of all colours, but 
principally purple and gold; the bow moving as you move; he never saw anything like this. 
3. Global warming issues 
3.1. Effect of global warming 
With increases in the Earth's global mean te mperature i.e., global warming, the various 
effects on climate change pose risks that increases. The IPCC ( 2001d and 2007d ) has 
organized many of these risks in to five "reasons for concern: 
x Threats to endangered spec ies and unique systems,  
x Damages from extrem e climate events,  
x Effects that fall most heavily on developing countries and  
x The poor within countries, global aggregate impacts (i.e., various measurements of total 
social, economic and ecological impacts), and large-scale high-impact events. 
The effects, or impacts, of climate change ma y be physical, ecological, social or economic. 
Evidence of observed climate change includes  the instrumental temperature record, rising 
sea levels, and decreased snow cover in th e Northern Hemisphere. According to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC, 2007a:10 ), "[most] of the observed 
increase in global average temperat ures since the mid-20th century is very likely  due to the 
observed increase in [human greenhouse gas] co ncentrations". It is predicted that future 
climate changes will include further global warm ing (i.e., an upward trend in global mean 
temperature), sea level rise, and a probable increase in the frequency of some extreme 
weather events. United Nations Framework Conv ention on Climate Change has agreed to 
implement policies designed to reduce  their emissions of greenhouse gases. 
3.2. Effect of climate change 
The phrase climate change is used to describe a change in the climate, measured in terms of 
its statistical properties, e.g., the global mean su rface temperature. In th is context, climate is 
taken to mean the average weather. Climate ca n change over period of time ranging from 
months to thousands or millions of years. The cl assical time period is 30 years, as defined by 
the World Meteorological Organization. The climate change referred to may be due to 
natural causes, e.g., changes in the sun's output, or due to hu man activities, e.g., changing 
the composition of the atmosphere. Any huma n-induced changes in climate will occur 
against the background of na tural climatic variations.  
Climate change reflects a change  in the energy balance of the c limate system, i.e. changes the 
relative balance between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation from 
Earth. When this balance changes it is called  " r a d i a t i v e  f o r c i n g " ,  a n d  t h e  c a l c u l a t i o n  a n d  
measurement of radiative forcing is one aspect of the science of climatology. The processes 
that cause such changes are ca lled "forcing mechanisms". Forcing mechanisms can be either 
"internal" or "external". Internal forcing mech anisms are natural processes within the climate  
Study of Impacts of Global Warming on Climate Change: Rise in Sea Leve l and Disaster Frequency 
 97 
system itself, e.g., the meridional turnover. External forcing mechanisms can be either 
natural (e.g., changes in solar output) or anthropogenic (e.g., increased emissions of 
greenhouse gases). 
Whether the initial forcing mechanism is intern al or external, the response of the climate 
system might be fast (e.g., a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight), 
slow (e.g. thermal expansion of warming ocean water), or a combination (e.g., sudden loss 
of albedo in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts, followed by more gradual thermal expansion of 
the water). Therefore, the climate system ca n respond abruptly, but the full response to 
forcing mechanisms might not be fully de veloped for centuries or even longer. 
The most general definition of climate change  is a change in the stat istical properties of the 
climate system when considered over long periods of time, regardless of cause,  whereas 
Global warming” refers to the change in th e Earth's global average surface temperature. 
Measurements show a global temperature increase  of 1.4 °F (0.78 °C) between the years 1900 
and 2005. Global warming is closely associated  w i t h  a  b r o a d  s p e c t r u m  o f  o t h e r  c l i m a t e  
changes, such as: 
x Increases in the frequency of intense rainfall,  
x Decreases in snow cover and sea ice,  
x More frequent and intense heat waves,  
x Rising sea levels, and  
x Widespread ocean acidification.  
3.2.1. Risk of intense rainfall 
There are two studied made here to elaborate the risk of intense rain fall one by United 
States and other one by United Kingdom. They  h a v e  w a r n e d  t h a t  t h e s e  r i s k s  a r e  d u e  t o  
extreme climate change, thus we  have to curb the global warming issues in phases. The 
summaries of study are given below: 
i. Two 500-Year Floods in Just 15 Years: In the United States, The Great Flood of 1993—
devastating communities along the Mississippi River and its tributaries in nine 
Midwestern states—was one of the most cost ly disasters. Thousands of Americans were 
displaced from their homes and forced to le ave their lives behind, hundreds of levees 
failed, and damages soared to an estimated $12 to 16 billion. A mere 15 years later, 
history is repeating itself in the Midwest as the rainswollen Cedar, Illinois, Missouri 
and Mississippi Rivers and their tributar ies top their banks and levees, leaving 
hundreds of thousands of people displaced.  With rainfall in May-June 2008 about two 
to three times greater than the long-term av erage, soybean planting is behind schedule 
and some crops may have to be replanted. This remarkably quick return of such severe 
flooding is not anticipated by currently used out-of-date methodologies, but is what we 
should expect as global warming leads to more frequent and intense severe storms. 
Inadequate floodplain management is also responsible for the extent of damages from 
both floods, especially over-reliance on le vees and the false sense of security they  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 98 
provide to those who live behind them. Abou t 28 percent of the total new development 
in the seven states over the past 15 years ha s been in areas within the 1993 flood events. 
The National Wildlife Federation says that  t o  l i m i t  t h e  m a g n i t u d e  o f  c h a n g e s  t o  t h e  
climate and the impacts on communities and wildlife, we must curb global warming 
pollution. The National Wildlife Federation recommends that policy makers, industry, 
and individuals take steps to reduce global warming pollution from today’s levels by 80 
percent by 2050. That’s a reduction of 20 perc ent per decade or just 2 percent per year. 
Science tells us that this is the only way to hold warming in the next century to no more 
than 2°F. This target is achievable with  t e c h n o l o g i e s  e i t h e r  a v a i l a b l e  o r  u n d e r  
development, but we need to start taking action now to avoid the worst impacts (See: 
www.nwf.org/globalwarming). 
ii. Extreme rainfall and flood risk in the UK:  Multi-day rainfall events are an important cause of 
recent severe flooding in the UK and any ch ange in the magnitude of such events may 
have severe impacts upon urban structures such as dams, urban drainage systems and 
flood defences and cause failures to occur. Regi onal pooling of 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-day annual 
maxima for 1961 to 2000 from 204 sites across the UK is used in a standard regional 
frequency analysis to produce GEV growth cu rves for long return-period rainfall events 
for each of nine defined climatological region s. Temporal changes in 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-day 
annual maxima are examined with L-moments using both a 10-year moving window and 
fixed decades from 1961-70, 1971-80, 1981-90 and 1991-2000. A bootstrap technique is then 
used to assess uncertainty in the fitted decada l growth curves and to identify significant 
trends in both distribution parameters and quantile estimates. 
There has been a two-part change in extr eme rainfall event occurrence across the UK 
from 1961-2000. Little change is observed at 1- and 2-day duration, but significant 
decadal level changes are seen in 5- and 10-da y events in many regions. In the south of 
the UK, growth curves have flattened and 5- and 10-day annual maxima have 
decreased during the 1990s. However, in the north, the 10-day growth curve has 
steepened and annual maxima have risen duri ng the 1990s. This is particularly evident 
in Scotland. The 50-year event in Scotland  during 1961-1990 has become an 8-, 11- and 
25-year event in the Eastern, Southern and Northern Scotland pooling regions 
respectively during the 1990s. In northern England the average re currence interval has 
also halved. This may have severe implications for design and planning practices in 
flood control.  
Increasing flood risk is now recognised as the most important sectoral threat from 
climate change in most parts of the world, with recent repeated severe flooding in the 
UK and Europe causing major loss of prop erty and life, and ca using the insurance 
industry to threaten the withdrawal of flood insurance cover from millions of UK 
households. This has prompted public debate  on the apparent increased frequency of 
extremes and focussed attention in partic ular on perceived increases in rainfall 
intensities. Climate model integrations pr edict increases in both the frequency and 
intensity of heavy rainfall in the high lati tudes under enhanced greenhouse conditions. 
These projections are consistent with recent in creases in rainfall inte nsity seen in the UK 
and worldwide.

3.2.2. Decreases in snow cover and sea ice 
Decreasing snow cover and land-ice extent continue to be positively correlat ed with increasing land-
surface temperatures: Satellite data show that it is quite lik ely to have been decreases of about 
10% in the extent of snow cover since the late  1960s. There is a highly significant correlation 
between increases in Northern Hemisphere land  temperatures and the decreases. There is 
now ample evidence to support a major retreat of  alpine and continental glaciers in response 
to 20th century warming. In a few maritime regions, increases in precipitation due to 
regional atmospheric circulation changes have  o v e r s h a d o w e d  i n c r e a s e s  i n  t e m p e r a t u r e  i n  
the past two decades, and glaciers have re -advanced. Over the past 100 to 150 years, 
ground-based observations show that there is possibility of a reduction of about two weeks 
in the annual duration of lake and river ice in  t h e  m i d -  t o  h i g h  l a t i t u d e s  o f  t h e  N o r t h e r n  
Hemisphere ( Fig.2 ). 
 
Figure 2.  Time-series of relative sea level for the past 300 years from Northern Europe: Amsterdam, 
Netherlands; Brest, France; Sheerness, UK; Stockholm, Sweden (detrended over the period 1774 to 1873 
to remove to first order the contribution of post -glacial rebound); Swinoujscie, Poland (formerly 
Swinemunde, Germany); and Liverpool, UK. Data for the latter are of "Adjusted Mean High Water" 
rather than Mean Sea Level and include a nodal (18.6 year) term. The scale bar indicates ±100 mm. 
Northern Hemisphere sea-ice  amounts are decreasing, but no significant trends in Antarctic sea-ice 
extent are apparent: A retreat of sea-ice extent in the Ar ctic spring and summer of 10 to 15% 
since the 1950s is consistent with an increase in  spring temperatures and, to a lesser extent, 
summer temperatures in the high latitudes. Ther e is little indication of reduced Arctic sea-
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 100 
ice extent during winter when temperatures have increased in the surrounding region. By 
contrast, there is no readily apparent relati onship between decadal changes of Antarctic 
temperatures and sea-ice extent since 1973. After an initial decrease in the mid-1970s, 
Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained stable, or even slightly increased. 
New data indicate that there likely has been an appr oximately 40% decline in Arctic sea-ice thickness 
in late summer to early autu mn between the period of 1958 to 1976 and the mid-1990s, and a 
substantially smaller decline in winter : The relatively short record length and incomplete 
sampling limit the interpretation of these da ta. Interannual variability and inter-decadal 
variability could be influencing these changes. 
3.2.3. More frequent and intense heat waves 
A recent study shows that an increase in he at-absorbing greenhouse gases intensifies an 
unusual atmospheric circulation pattern already observed during heat waves in Europe and 
North America. As the pattern becomes more pronounced, severe heat waves occur in the 
Mediterranean region and the southern and we stern United States. Other parts of France, 
Germany and the Balkans also become more susceptible to severe heat waves. "Extreme 
weather events will have some of the most severe impacts on human society as climate 
changes, "says Meehl.  
Heat waves can kill more people in a shorter time than almost any other climate event. 
According to records, 739 people died as a resu lt of Chicago's July, 1995, heat wave. Fifteen 
thousand Parisians are estimated to have di ed from heat in August, 2003, along with 
thousands of farm animals. For the study, Meehl and Tebaldi compared present (1961-1990) 
and future (2080-2099) decades to determine how greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols 
might affect future climate in Europe and the United States, fo cusing on Paris and Chicago. 
They assumed little policy interv ention to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases. During the 
Paris and Chicago heat waves, atmospheric pressure rose to values higher than usual over 
Lake Michigan and Paris, producing clear skies and prolonged heat. In the model, 
atmospheric pressure increases even more duri ng heat waves in both regions as carbon 
dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere. 
Heat wave is based on the concept of exceedin g specific thresholds, thus allowing analyses 
of heat wave duration and frequency. Three criteria were used to define heat waves in this 
way, which relied on two location-specific thresholds for maximum temperatures. 
Threshold 1 (T1) was defined as the 97.5th percentile of the distribution of maximum 
temperatures in the observations and in the simulated present-day climate (seasonal 
climatology at the given location), and T2 wa s defined as the 81st percentile. A heat wave 
was then defined as the longest period of co nsecutive days satisfying the following three 
conditions: 
i. The daily maximum temperature must be above T1 for at least 3 days,  
ii. The average daily maximum temperature must be above T1 for the entire period, and  
iii. The daily maximum temperature must be abov e T2 for every day of the entire period.

 101 
Because the Chicago heat wave of 1995 and the Paris heat wave of 2003 had particularly 
severe impacts, we chose grid points from th e model that were close to those two locations 
to illustrate heat wave characteristics. This choice was subjective and illustrative given that 
there are, of course, other well-known heat wa ves from other locations. Also, we are not 
suggesting that a model grid point is similar to a particular weather station; we picked these 
grid points because they represent heat wave co nditions for regions representative of Illinois 
and France in the model, and th erefore they can help identify processes that contribute to 
changes in heat waves in the future climate in those regions. We chose comparable grid 
points from the National Centers for Enviro nmental Prediction (NCEP)/NCAR reanalyses 
that used assimilated observational data for comparison to the model results. 
Heat waves in Chicago, Paris, and elsewher e in North America and Europe will become 
more intense, more frequent and longer last ing in the 21st century, according to a new 
modeling study by two scientists at the Nation al Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) 
in Boulder, Colo. In the United States, heat waves will become most severe in the West and 
South. The findings appear in the August 13(2004)  issue of the journal Science. Gerald Meehl 
and Claudia Tebaldi, both of NCAR, examined  E a r t h ' s  f u t u r e  c l i m a t e  u s i n g  t h e  P a r a l l e l  
Climate Model, developed by NCAR and th e U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  
During the 1995 Chicago heat wave, the most severe health impacts resulted from the lack of 
cooling relief several nights in a row, according to health experts. In the model, the western 
and southern United States and the Mediterrane an region of Europe experience a rise in 
nighttime minimum temperatures of more than 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) 
three nights in a row. They will occur more often: The average number of heat waves in the 
Chicago area increases in the coming century by 25 percent, from "Heat Waves of the 21st 
Century: More Intense, More Frequent and Longer Lasting." (Source: PHYSorg.com. 12 Aug 
2004, http://phys.org/news806.html Pa ge 1/21.66 per year to 2.08).  
In Paris, the average number increases 31percent , from 1.64 per year to 2.15. They will last 
longer: Chicago's present heat wa ves last from 5.39 to 8.85 days; future events increase to 
between 8.5 and 9.24 days. In Paris, present-da y heat waves persist from 8.33 to 12.69 days; 
they stretch to between 11.39 and 17.04 days in  f u t u r e  d e c a d e s . ( S o u r c e :  N a t i o n a l  S c i e n c e

3.2.4. Observed changes in sea level 
Based on tide gauge data, the rate of global mean sea level rise during the 20th century is in 
the range 1.0 to 2.0 mm/yr, with a central value of 1.5 mm/yr (the central value should not be 
interpreted as a best estimate.  
i. The causes for change of the sea level:  At the shoreline it is determined by many factors in 
the global environment that operate on a grea t range of time-scales, from hours (tidal) 
to millions of years (ocean basin changes du e to tectonics and sedimentation). On the 
time-scale of decades to centuries, some of the largest influences on the average levels 
of the sea are linked to climat e and climate change processes.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 102 
Firstly, as ocean water warms, it expands.  O n  t h e  b a s i s  o f  o b s e r v a t i o n s  o f  o c e a n  
temperatures and model results, thermal expa nsion is believed to be one of the major 
contributors to historical sea level changes. Further, thermal expansion is expected to 
contribute the largest component to sea leve l rise over the next hundred years. Deep 
ocean temperatures change only slowly; th erefore, thermal expansion would continue 
for many centuries even if the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases were to 
stabilise. 
The amount of warming and the depth of water affected vary with location. In addition, 
warmer water expands more than colder wate r for a given change in temperature. The 
geographical distribution of sea level change  results from the geographical variation of 
thermal expansion, changes in salinity, wi nds, and ocean circulation. The range of 
regional variation is substantial compared  with the global average sea level rise. 
ii. Rise in sea Level:  Sea level also changes when the mass of water in the ocean increases or 
decreases. This occurs when ocean water is  exchanged with the water stored on land. 
The major land store is the water frozen in  g l a c i e r s  o r  i c e  s h e e t s .  I n d e e d ,  t h e  m a i n  
reason for the lower sea level during the la st glacial period was the amount of water 
stored in the large extension of the ice sheets on the continents of the Northern 
Hemisphere. After thermal expansion, the melt ing of mountain glaciers and ice caps is 
expected to make the largest contribution to the rise of sea level over the next hundred 
years. These glaciers and ice caps make up only a few per cent of the world's land-ice 
area, but they are more sensitive to clim ate change than the larger ice sheets in 
Greenland and Antarctica, because the ice sheets are in colder climates with low 
precipitation and low melting rates. Consequently, the large ice sheets are expected to 
make only a small net contribution to sea level change in the coming decades. 
3.2.5. Widespread ocean acidification 
A new study says the seas are acidifying ten times faster today than 55 million years ago when a mass 
extinction of marine species occurred. And, the st udy concludes, current changes in ocean chemistry 
due to the burning of fossil fuels may portend a new wave of die-offs.  I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  t h e  v a s t  
clouds of shelled creatures in  t h e  d e e p  o c e a n s  h a d  v i r t u a l l y  d i s a p p e a r e d .  M a n y  s c i e n t i s t s  
now agree that this change was caused by a drastic drop of the ocean’s pH level. The 
seawater became so corrosive that it ate away  at the shells , along  with other species with 
calcium carbonate in their bodies. It took hund reds of thousands of years for the oceans to 
recover from this crisis, and for the sea floor to turn from red back to white. The clay that the 
crew of the JOIDES Resolution  dredged up may be an ominous warning of what the future 
has in store. By spewing carbon dioxide into  t h e  a i r ,  w e  a r e  n o w  o n c e  a g a i n  m a k i n g  t h e

3.3. Historical impacts of climate change 
Approximately one millenn ium after the 7 Ka (32nd C e n t u r y  B C E )  s l o w i n g  o f  s e a - l e v e l  r i s e ,  
many coastal urban centers rose to prominence around the world (Day, John W., et al. 2007). It

has been hypothesized that this is correla ted with the development of stable coastal 
environments and ecosystems and an increase in marine productivity (also related to an 
increase in temperatures), which would provide a food source for hierarchical urban societies.  
The last written records of the Norse Greenland ers are from a 1408 marria ge in the church of 
Hvalsey — today the best-preserved of the Nors e ruins. Climate change has been associated 
with the historical collapse of civilizations, ci ties and dynasties. Notable examples of this 
include the Anasazi (Demenocal, P. B. 2001) , Classic Maya (Hodell, David A., 1995), the 
Harappa, the Hittites, and Ancient Egyp t (Jonathan Cowie, 2007). Other, smaller 
communities such as the Viking settlement of Greenland (transl. with introd. by Magnus 
Magnusson, 1983), have also suffered collapse  w i t h  c l i m a t e  c h a n g e  b e i n g  a  s u g g e s t e d  
contributory factor (Diamond, Jared, 2005).  
There are two proposed methods of Classi c Maya collapse: environmental and non-
environmental. The environmen tal approach uses paleoclimatic evidence to show that 
movements in the intertropical convergence zone likely caused severe, extended droughts 
during a few time periods at the end of the archaeological record for the classic Maya 
(Haug, Gh, et al., 2003). The non-environmenta l approach suggests that the collapse could 
be due to increasing class tensions associated with the building of monumental architecture 
and the corresponding decline of agriculture (Hosler D, et  a l . ,  1 9 7 7 ) ,  i n c r e a s e d  d i s e a s e  
(Santley, Robert S.,et al., 1986) and increased in ternal warfare (Foias, An tonia E., et al.,1997). 
The Harappa and Indus civilizations were a ffected by drought 4,500–3,500 years ago. A 
decline in rainfall in the Mi ddle East and Northern India 3,800–2,500 is likely to have 
affected the Hittites and Ancient Egypt. 
Notable periods of climate change in recorded history include the medieval warm period and 
the little ice age. In the case of the Norse, th e medieval warm period was associated with the 
Norse age of exploration and arctic colonization, and the later colder periods led to the decline 
of those colonies  (Patterson, W.P., et al., 2007). Climate change in the recent past may be 
detected by corresponding chan ges in settlement and agricultur al patterns. Archaeological 
evidence, oral history and historical documents can offer insights into  p a s t  c h a n g e s  i n  t h e  
climate. Climate change effects have been link ed to the collapse of various civilizations.  
3.4. Global warming impa cts of climate change 
According to different levels of future global wa rming, impacts of climate has been used in the 
IPCC's Assessment Report s on climate change ( Schneider DH, et al., 2007 ). The instrumental 
temperature record shows global warming of around 0.6 °C over the entire 20th century ( IPCC 
2007d.1 ). The future level of global warming is uncertain, but a wide range of estimates 
(projections) have been made ( Fisher, BS et al., 2007 ). The IPCC's "SRES" scenarios have been 
frequently used to make projections of future climate change ( Karl, 2009 ). Climate models 
using the six SRES "marker" scenarios suggest futu re warming of 1.1 to 6.4 °C by the end of the 
21st century (above average global temperatures ov er the 1980 to 1999 time period as shown in 
Fig.3 ) (IPCC 2007d.3 ). The projected rate of warming under these scenarios would very likely 
be without precedent during at least the last 10,000 years ( IPCC 2001-SPM ). The most recent  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 104 
warm period comparable to these projection s was the mid-Pliocene, around 3 million years 
ago ( Stern N., 2008 ). At that time, models suggest that mean global temperatures were about 2–
3 °C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures ( Jansen E., et al., 2007 ).  
 
Figure 3.  Global Land-Ocean, mean surface temperature difference from the average for 1880–2009 
(Courtesy: Wikipedia.com) 
The most recent report IPCC projected that during the 21st century the global surface 
temperature is likely to rise a further1.1 to 2.9 °C (2 to 5.2 °F) for the lowest emissions 
scenario used in the report and 2.4 to 6. 4 °C (4.3 to 11.5 °F) for the highest ( Fig.4 ).  
3.5. Physical impacts of climate change 
Working Group I's contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, published in 2007, 
concluded that warming of the climate system was "unequivocal” ( Solomon S, 2007a ). This 
was based on the consistency of evidence ac ross a range of observed changes, including 
increases in global average air and ocean te mperatures, widespread melting of snow and 
ice, and rising global average sea level( Solomon S, 2007b ).  
Human activities have contributed to a numb er of the observed changes in climate ( Hegerl 
GC, et. al., 2007 ). This contribution has principally b een through the burning of fossil fuels, 
which has led to an increase in the concentrat ion of GHGs in the atmosphere. This increase 
in GHG concentrations has caused a radiative forcing of the climate in the direction of 
warming. Human-induced forcing of the climate has likely to contributed to a number of 
observed changes, including sea level rise, ch anges in climate extremes (such as warm and 
cold days), declines in Arctic sea ice extent, and to glacier retreat ( Fig.5 & 6 ).

Human-induced warming could potentially lead to some impacts that are abrupt or 
irreversible. The probability of warming having unforeseen consequences increases with the 
rate, magnitude, and duration of climate change.

3.6. Climate change effects on weather 
Observations show that there have been changes in weather ( Le Treut H, et. al., 2007 ). As 
climate changes, the probabilities of certain type s of weather events are affected. Changes have 
been observed in the amount, intensity, freque ncy, and type of precipitation. Widespread 
increases in heavy precipitation have occurred, even in places where total rain amounts have 
decreased. IPCC (2007d) concluded that human in fluences had, more likely than not (greater 
than 50% probability, based on ex pert judgment), contributed to an increase in the frequency 
of heavy precipitation events. Projections of future changes in precipitation show overall 
increases in the global average, but with substantial shifts in where and how precipitation falls. 
Climate models tend to project increasing prec ipitation at high latitu des and in the tropics 
(e.g., the south-east monsoon region and over the tropical Pacific) and de creasing precipitation 
in the sub-tropics (e.g., over much of No rth Africa and the northern Sahara).  
Evidence suggests that, since th e 1970s, there have been substant ial increases in the intensity 
and duration of tropical storms and hurricanes.  Models project a general tendency for more 
intense but fewer storms  outside the tropics. 
3.7. Extreme weather, tropical cyclone, and list of atlantics hurricane records 
Since the late 20th century, changes have been  o b s e r v e d  i n  t h e  t r e n d s  o f  s o m e  e x t r e m e  
weather and climate events, e.g., heat waves. Human activities have, with varying degrees 
of confidence, contributed to some of th ese observed trends. Projections for the 21st century 
suggest continuing changes in trends for some extreme events ( Fig.7 ). Solomon et al.  (2007), 
for example, projected the following likely (gre ater than 66% probability, based on expert 
judgment) changes: 
x an increase in the area s affected by drought; 
x increased tropical cyclone activity; and 
x increased incidence of extreme high  sea level (excluding tsunamis). 
Projected changes in extreme events will have predominantly adverse impacts on 
ecosystems and human society.  
3.7.1. Triggering earthquakes, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions 
Scientists are to outline dramatic evidence that global warming threatens the planet in a new 
and unexpected way – by triggering earthquakes, tsunamis, avalanches and volcanic eruptions. 
It is assessed that the Melting glaciers will se t off avalanches, floods and mud flows in the Alps 
and other mountain ranges; torrential rainfall in the UK is likely to cause widespread erosion; 
while disappearing Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets threaten to let loose underwater 
landslides, triggering tsunamis that could even strike the seas around Britain. 
At the same time the disappearance of ice ca ps will change the pressures acting on the 
Earth's crust and set off volcanic eruptions ac ross the globe. Life on Earth faces a warm 
future – and a fiery one.

Not only are the oceans and atmosphere conspiring against us , bringing baking 
temperatures, more powerful storms and floods , but the crust beneath our feet seems likely 
to join in too, said Professor Bill McGuire, di rector of the Benfield Hazard Research Centre, 
at University College London (UCL). 
 
Study of Impacts of Global Warming on Climate Change: Rise in Sea Leve l and Disaster Frequency 
 109 
Maybe the Earth is trying to tell us something,  added McGuire, who is one of the organisers 
of UCL's Climate Forcing of Geological Hazards . Some of the key evidence will come from 
studies of past volcanic activity. These indica te that when ice sheets disappear the number 
of eruptions increases, said Professor David Pyle, of Oxford University's earth sciences 
department. 
The last ice age came to an end between 12, 000 to 15,000 years ago and the ice sheets that 
once covered central Europe shrank dramatica lly, added Pyle. The impact on the continent's 
geology can be measured by the jump in volcanic activity that occurred at this time. 
In the Eiffel region of western Germany a huge  e r u p t i o n  c r e a t e d  a  v a s t  c a l d e r a ,  o r  b a s i n -
shaped crater, 12,900 years ago, fo r example. This has since flood ed to form the Laacher See, 
near Koblenz. Scientists are now studying vo lcanic regions in Chile and Alaska – where 
glaciers and ice sheets are shrinkin g rapidly as the planet heats up – in an effort to anticipate 
the eruptions that might be set off. 
Recently scientists from Northern Arizon a University reported in the journal Science  that 
temperatures in the Arctic were now higher th an at any time in the past 2,000 years. Ice 
sheets are disappearing at a dramatic rate – an d these could have other, unexpected impacts 
on the planet's geology. 
According to Professor Mark Maslin of UCL, one is likely to be the release of the planet's 
methane hydrate deposits. These ice-like depo sits are found on the seabed and in the 
permafrost regions of Siberia and the far nort h. These permafrost deposits are now melting 
and releasing their methane, said Maslin. You can see the methane bubbling out of lakes in 
Siberia. And that is a concern, for the impact of methane in the atmosphere is considerable. 
It is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. 
 
Figure 8.  Earthquake 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 110 
A build-up of permafrost methane in the at mosphere would produce a further jump in 
global warming and accelerate the process of climate change. Even more worrying, 
however, is the impact of rising sea temperat ures on the far greater reserves of methane 
hydrates that are found on the sea floor. It wa s not just the warming of the sea that was the 
problem, added Maslin. As the ice around Greenland and Antarctica melted, sediments 
would pour off land masses and cliffs would crumble, triggering underwater landslides that 
would break open more hydrate reserves on th e sea-bed. Again there would be a jump in 
global warming. These are key issues that we  w i l l  h a v e  t o  i n v e s t i g a t e  o v e r  t h e  n e x t  f e w  
years, he said. 
There is also a danger of earthquakes, triggere d by disintegrating glaciers, causing tsunamis 
off Chile, New Zealand and Newfoundland in Canada, NASA scientist Tony Song said 
recently ( Fig.8 ). The last on this list could even se nd a tsunami across the Atlantic, one that 
might reach British shores. From other experts, it is said that the risk posed by melting ice in 
mountain regions, which would pose significan t dangers to local people and tourists. The 
Alps, in particular, face a worryingly uncertain future, said Jasper Knight of Exeter 
University. Rock walls resting against glaciers will become unstable as the ice disappears 
and so set off avalanches. In addition, increasing melt-water s will trigger more floods and 
mud flows. 
For the Alps this is a serious problem. Tourism is growing there, while the region's 
population is rising. Managing and protecting these people was now an issue that needed to 
be addressed as a matter of urgency, Knight said. "Global warming is not just a matter of 
warmer weather, more floods or stronger hurri canes. It is a wake-up call to Terra Firma," 
McGuire said. 
3.7.2. Major storms could submerge New York city in next decade 
Sea-level rise due to climate change could cri pple the city in Irene-like storm scenarios, new 
climate report claims Irene-like storms of th e future would put a third of New York City 
streets under water and flood many of the tunne ls leading into Manhattan in under an hour 
because of climate change, a new state government report warns Wednesday 16th Nov’ 2011 
(Fig.9). 
Sea level rise due to climate change would leave lower Manhattan dangerously exposed to 
flood surges during major stor ms, the report, which looks at the impact of climate change 
across the entire state of New York, warns. The risks and the impact s are huge, said Art 
deGaetano, a climate scientist at  Cornell University and lead author of the ClimAID study. 
Clearly areas of the city that are currently inha bited will be uninhabitable with the rising of 
the sea. 
Factor in storm surges, and the scenario become s even more frightening, he said. Subway 
tunnels get affected, airports - both LaGuardia and Kennedy sit right at sea level - and when 
you are talking about the lowest areas of the ci ty you are talking about the business districts. 
The report, commissioned by the New York  S t a t e  E n e r g y  R e s e a r c h  a n d  D e v e l o p m e n t   
Study of Impacts of Global Warming on Climate Change: Rise in Sea Leve l and Disaster Frequency 
 111 
Authority, said the effects of sea level rise and changing weather patterns would be felt as 
early as the next decade. 
 
Figure 9.  The Manhattan skyline as Hurricane Irene approached 
By the mid-2020s, sea level rise around Manhatta n and Long Island could be up to 10 inches, 
assuming the rapid melting of polar sea ice cont inues. By 2050, sea-rise could reach 2.5ft and 
more than 4.5ft by 2080 under the same conditions . In such a scenario, many of the tunnels - 
subway, highway, and rail - crossing into th e Bronx beneath the Harlem River, and under 
the East River would be flooded within the ho ur, the report said. Some transport systems 
could be out of operation for up to a month. 
The report, which was two years in the making , was intended to help the New York state 
government take steps now to get people out of  harm's way - and factor climate change into 
long-term planning to protect transport, water and sewage systems. New York mayor 
Michael Bloomberg was so concerned that he we nt on to commission an even more detailed 
study of the city after receiving early briefings on the report. That makes him an outlier 
among his fellow Republicans, who blocked funds for creating a new climate service in 
budget negotiations in Congress this week. 
DeGaetano said climate change would force gove rnments to begin rethinking infrastructure. 
Most of New York City's power plants, wate r treatment plants, and sewage systems are 
right at sea level. City planners are also going to have to help people adapt. More than half a 
million people live in the New York flood plain, and, as the report noted, a significant 
portion of them are African American and La tinos. And floods are not the only potential 
danger of climate change. The report notes that New York could face average annual 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 112 
temperature rises of up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the middle of this century and by as 
much as 9 degrees by 2080. 
In summer months, this could subject New Yo rkers to power shortages and the risk of 
black-outs because of the extra need for air co nditioning. Those without air conditioning - or 
who cannot afford the higher electricity bills - wo uld be at greater risk of heat stroke. Those 
hotter conditions would have effects right across the state, playing havoc with New York 
State’s wine and agricultural industries. Spruce and Fir trees would disappear from the 
Catskills and West Hudson River Valley, dairy cows would suffer heat stress, and popular 
apple varieties would decline, the report said. 
4. IPCC expected to confirm link between climate change and extreme 
weather 
Climate change is likely to cause more st orms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and other 
extreme weather events, according to the most authoritative review yet of the effects of 
global warming. Report likely to conclude that man-made emissions are increasing the 
frequency of storms, floods and droughts on Thursday- 17 November 2011 16.32 GMT from 
New York. The Intergovernmental Panel on C limate Change will publish on 18 November 
2011, its first special report on extreme weather,  and its relationship to rising greenhouse gas 
emissions. The final details are being fought over by governments, as the "summary for 
policymakers" of the report has to be agreed in full by every nation that chooses to be 
involved. But the conclusions are expected to be that emissions from  human activities are 
increasing the frequency of ex treme weather events. In partic ular, there are likely to be 
many more heatwaves, droughts and changes in rainfall patterns. 
Jake Schmidt of the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council said: This report should 
be a wake-up call to those that believe that c limate change is some distant issue that might 
impact someone else. The report documents that extreme weather is happening now and 
that global warming will bring very dangerous ev ents in the future. From the report you can 
see that extreme weather will impact everyone in  one way or another. This is a window into 
the future if our political response doesn't change quickly. 
This special report - one of only two that the IPCC is publishing before its 2014 
comprehensive assessment of the state of c limate change science - is particularly 
controversial as it deals with the relation ship between man-made climate change and 
damaging events such as storms, floods and droughts. Some climate change skeptics and 
scientists cast doubt on whether the observed increase in extreme weather events can be 
attributed directly to human actions, or whethe r much of it is due to natural variability in 
the weather ( Fig. 10 ). 
The IPCC, a body of the world's leading climat e scientists convened by  the United Nations, 
is likely to conclude that extreme weather can be linked to man-made climate change, but 
that individual weather events can at present only rarely be linked directly to global 
warming.

The Red Cross warned that disaster agencies we re already dealing with the effects of climate 
change in vulnerable countries across the world. "The findings of this report certainly tally 
with what the Red Cross Movement is seeing, which is a rise in the number of weather-
related emergencies around the world," said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross / 
Red Crescent Climate Centre and coordinating  l e a d  a u t h o r  o f  t h e  I P C C  r e p o r t .  " W e  a r e  
committed to responding to disasters whenever and wherever they happen, but we have to 
recognise that if the number of disasters continues to increase, the current model we have 
for responding to them is simply impossible to sustain."

with the relationship between man-made climate change and extreme weather. (Photograph: 
K.M.Chaudary/AP) 
Insurers are also worried. Mark Way, of the insu rance giant Swiss Re, told the Guardian that 
the massive increase in insurance claims was ca using serious concern. He said that between 
1970 and 1989, the insurance indust ry globally had paid out an average of $5bn a year in 
weather-related claims, but that this had in creased enormously to $27bn a year. Although 
not all of this was attributable to climate ch ange - increasing population, urbanisation and 
prosperity also play a major part - he said in surers wanted governments to get to grips with 
the effects of climate change in order to prep are for likely damage and tackle the causes of 
global warming. 
Mike Hulme at the Tyndall Centre said it would be dangerous for governments to use this 
report in order to justify directing overseas ai d only to those countrie s that could be proved 
to be suffering from climate ch ange, rather than other problems. In that scenario, he said: 
"Funding will no longer go to those who are mo st at risk from climate-impacts and with low 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 114 
adaptive capacity, but will go to those who are lucky enough to live in regions of the world 
where weather extremes happen to be most attributable by climate models to human 
agency. These regions tend to be in mid-to-hig h latitudes, with lots of good weather data 
and well calibrated models. So, goodbye Africa." 
5. Conclusion 
From the various studies and reports, it is evid ent that the with the current rate of carbon 
dioxide release in the atmosphere there woul d not only be the increase in the global 
temperature, but it will also cause rise in sea,  level and increase the frequency of disasters. 
The following major challenges ar e noticed from the above study: 
x Emissions from human activities are incr easing the frequency of extreme weather 
events. In particular, there are likely to be many more heatwaves, droughts and changes 
in rainfall patterns. 
x The temperature is estimated to increase by 2 to 6o Celsius within year 2100, which is a 
tremendous increase from our cu rrent average temperature of 1.7o Celsius (IPCC). 
x By the mid-2020s, sea level rise around Manha ttan and Long Island could be up to 10 
inches, assuming the rapid melting of polar sea ice continues. By 2050, sea-rise could 
reach 2.5ft and more than 4.5ft by 2080 under the same conditions. 
x Global warming threatens the planet in a new and unexpected way – by triggering 
earthquakes, tsunamis, avalanch es and volcanic eruptions. 
x Irene-like storms of the future would put a third of New York City streets under water 
and flood many of the tunnels leading into Manhattan in under an hour because of 
climate change. 
These are few glimpses of future suspects; th ere may be much more bad implications of 
evils of climate change globally and humanity  will be at hig h  risk , devel opm ents will g et 
shattered and rescue efforts w ill gain higher priorities

1. Introduction 
While focusing on some critical points such  a s  d e c r e a s i n g  g l o b a l  w a r m i n g  a n d  a m b i e n t  
pollution, better utilization of renewable energy resources, energy management and 
improvement of power systems operation becomes the field of attention for many modern 
societies, power and energy engineers, academi cs, researchers and stakeholders everywhere 
are pondering the problems of depletion of fossi l fuel resources, poor energy efficiency and 
environmental pollution. Besides, the convention al power grids and their assets that span 
large areas of the earth and form huge inte rconnected meshes, not only have a close 
relationship with social and ec onomic activities, bu t also generate a substantial amount of 
criteria air pollutants, as evident by the co ntinuing development of new rules under the 
clean air act for the electric power sector. One of  the main disadvantages of such networks is 
their reliance on large centralized power gene ration units which produce particulate and 
gaseous emission pollutants. In other words, coal-fired power plants together with fossil 
fuel power stations that make a large portio n of generation companies (GenCos) are the 
major contributors in pollutants include Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), fine particulates, oxides 
of nitrogen (NO x), oxides of sulfur (SO x) and mercury (Hg), which are thought to cause 
global warming. They are also contributing to carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions as well as 
producing solid waste in the form of fly as h and bottom ash. Therefore, a new trend for 
modernization of the electricity distribution  s y s t e m  a n d  g e n e r a t i o n  s e c t o r  h a s  b e e n  
proposed to address these issues  suitably. This plan of action mainly focuses on generating 
energy locally at distribution voltage level through incorporation of small-scale, low carbon, 
non-conventional and renewable energy sources,  s u c h  a s  w i n d ,  s o l a r ,  f u e l  c e l l ,  b i o g a s ,  
natural gas, microturbines, etc., and their inte gration into the utility distribution network. 
Generally, such energy choices are regarded as  d i s p e r s e d  o r  d i s t r i b u t e d  g e n e r a t i o n  ( D G )  
and the generators are termed as distributed energy resources (DERs) or microsources. On 
the other hand, conventional power grids whic h are mostly passive distribution networks  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 120 
with one-way electricity transportation are in the era of major modification and alteration 
into active distribution networks (ADNs)  w i t h  D E R s  a n d  b i d i r e c t i o n a l  e l e c t r i c i t y  
transportation (Chowdhury et al., 2008a,2008b). In this regard, flexible and intelligent 
control systems must be incorporated in AD Ns to exploit clean energy from renewable 
DERs. Advanced systems and key technologies should be also employed for integration of 
DERs. With low incorporation of renewable ener gy sources (RESs) the total effect on grid 
operations is confined, but as the penetratio ns of such resources increase, their mutual 
effects increase too (Angel & Rújula, 2009 ; Clark & Isherwood, 2004). Nevertheless, harness 
of RESs, even when there are good potential resources, may be problematic due to their 
variable and intermittent natures, thus RESs cannot necessarily be operated in a 
conventional manner. Instead, RESs behaviors can be predicted via expert estimators and 
the forecast information is exactly the kind of information that an ADN must uses to 
improve system efficiency (Cho wdhury et al., 2008c, 2008d).  
2. Smart Micro-Grids: A true way to mitigate global warming 
It was mentioned earlier that existing transmission and distribution systems in many parts 
of the world use technologies and strategies th at are many decades old. They make limited 
use of digital communication and control techno logies. To update this aging infrastructure 
and to create a power system that meets to day’s growing and changi ng needs, developed 
societies try to create intelligent means whic h use advanced sensing, communication, and 
control technologies to distribute electricity more effectively, economically and securely. 
Additionally, there are some important side be nefits for the consumers such as potential 
lower cost, higher service reliability,   better power quality, increased energy efficiency and 
energy independence that are all reasons for an  i n c r e a s e d  i n t e r e s t  i n  d i s t r i b u t e d  e n e r g y  
resources and focusing on what are called “S mart Micro-Grids”, as the future of power 
systems. Although the term “Smart Grid” is freq uently used today, there is no agreement on 
its definition. In other words, the concept of intelligence in Smart Grid design and how it 
will be measured is unclear. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) mentioned in one of its 
recent issues that a Smart Grid uses digital technology to improve reliability, security and 
efficiency of the electric system from larg e generation, through the delivery systems to 
electricity consumers and a growing number  o f  d i s t r i b u t e d - g e n e r a t i o n  a n d  s t o r a g e  
resources (U.S. DOE, 2008). Later, in June 2008, a meeting of industry le aders was held at the 
U.S. Department of Energy and seven different characteristics were declared for the Smart 
Grid concept: 
1. Better utilization of  conventional asse ts, optimization and efficient operation, 
2. Accommodation of all generation an d storage options in power grids, 
3. Supply of power quality as a great need of today’s industry, 
4. Prediction of events and fast  response to system disturbances in a self-healing manner, 
5. Robust operation against attacks and natural disasters, 
6. Active participation of consumers, 
7. Introduction of new servic es, products and markets.  
Global Warming Mitigation Using Smart Micro-Grids 121 
While details vary greatly about the definition of a Smart Grid, a general definition can be 
made as follow: A Smart Grid is an intelligen t, auto-balancing, self-healing power grid that 
accepts any source of fuel as its input and tr ansforms it into a consumer’s end use with 
minimal human intervention. It is a course of action that will result in better utilization of 
renewable energy resources and reduce environmen tal vestiges as much as possible. It has a 
sense of detection to understand where it is loaded beyond capacity and has the ability to 
reroute power to lessen overload and impede potential outages. It is a base that provides 
real-time communication between consumers an d the utility in order to optimize energy 
harvesting based on environmental benefits or  c o s t  p r e f e r e n c e s .  H o w e v e r ,  i t  s h o u l d  b e  
noted that deployment of Smart Grid technologi es will occur over a long period of time, 
adding successive layers of functionality an d capability onto existing equipment and 
systems. Although technology is the focal point,  it is only a way to achieve the goal, and the 
smart grid should be defined by more extens ive characteristics (Anv ari Moghaddam et al., 
2010b, 2010c, 2011b). How the Smart Grid differs fr om conventional grids we know today, is 
illustrated in Figs. 1, 2. Conventional networks are designed to support large power units 
that serve faraway consumers via one-way transm ission and distribution grids (Fig.1), but 
the future grids will necessarily be two-way real time systems, where power is generated 
not only by a large number of small and di stributed energy resources but also by large 
power plants(ABB, 2009). Power flow across the network is based on a mesh grid structure 
rather than a hierarchical one (Fig. 2). 
 
Figure 1.  Conventional power system 
Likewise, the term “Micro-Grid” in its whole vision, is an exemplar of a macro-grid in 
which local energy potentials are mutually connected with each other as well as with the 
L.V utility and make a small-scaled power gr id.  In such a network, DGs are exploited 
extensively both in forms of renewable (e.g., wind and solar) and non-conventional 
(micro-turbine, fuel cell, diesel generator)  r e s o u r c e s ,  b e c a u s e  t h e s e  e m e r g i n g  p r i m e  
movers have lower emission and the potentia l to have lower cost negating traditional 
economies of scale (Anvari Moghaddam et al., 2011c, 2012). In addition to DGs, storage 
options are also used widely to offset expensive energy purchases from utility or to store 
energy during off-peak hours for an anticipa ted price spike (Divya & Østergaard, 2009; 
 
Global Warming – Impacts and Future Perspective 122 
Kaldellis & Zafirakis, 2007). In a typical Micro-Grid, DERs generally have different 
owners handle the autonomous operation of the grid with the help of local controllers ( ΐc 
or MGLC) which are joined with each DER and Micro-Grid central controller ( ΐcc o r  
MGCC). Moreover, the central co ntrol unit (CCU), which is a part of MGCC, does the 
optimization process to achieve a robust and optimal plan of action for the smart 
operation of the Micro-Grid

2.1. Impacts of Smart Grids on energy efficiency and low carbon economy 
From a utility point of view, implementation of  a Smart Grid can yield several advantages 
over the conventional one, as shown in Fig. 3. A Smart Grid can organize operations and 
enable utilities to tap into new paths to save energy and reduce enviro nmental footprints to 
levels greater than would otherwise be attainable (Abbasi & Seifi, 2010).   
As the figure shows, selected mechanisms em powered by a Smart Grid, represent pathways 
to energy savings and/or emission reductions , although some of these benefits overlap 
across the various goals. For example, indirect feedback to customers using improved 
billing is related to improvements both in op erational efficiency and customer energy use 
behavior. Similarly, greater op tions for dynamic pricing and demand response are related to 
customer service enhancement as well as to demand response activation. It’s also notable 
that some of the ways associated with the me ntioned goals are slight ly indirect or their 
energy savings potentials are difficult to ex press on a national standard, because they 
include complex market, institutional, and behavioral interactions that can vary 
considerably across the nations (Europea n Commission, 2006). Considering different 
mechanisms have been identified earlier, this section of the work highlights the more direct 
ways for energy savings and reduced carbon emi ssions in order to get better insight into the 
Smart Grid environmental benefits. As shown in  F i g .  3 ,  t w o  o f  t h e  p a t h w a y s  c a n  d i r e c t l y  
reduce carbon emissions while inducing energy savings: (i) higher penetration of RESs and 
their greater integration into the grid enviro nment and (ii) further utilization of plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fa cilitation of their deployments.

Figure 3.  Smart Grid mechanisms for energy efficiency & emission reduction 
2.1.1. Integration of renewable energy sources  
A Smart Grid facilitates more seamless integrat ion of RESs and other DERs including energy 
storage options due to its advanced control an d communications capabilities. Earlier studies 
have indicated that energy storage can compen sate for the stochastic nature and sudden 
deficiencies of RESs for short periods without suffering loss of load events, and without the 
need to start more generating plants (A nvari Moghaddam et al., 2010a, 2011a). Moreover, 
with higher penetration rates of renewables such as wind and solar in the overall supply 
mix, utilities will decrease their carbon emissi ons and will be better situated to meet their 
corresponding states’ renewable portfolio standard (RPS) mandates.  In a same manner, 
customers not only receive a greater share of green power from the utility, but also integrate 
their individual microsources and/or renewabl e options (e.g., rooftop photovoltaic systems) 
into the grid for participation in net metering programs. From the other point of view, all 
advantages of non-conventional or renewable low-carbon generation technologies and high-
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 124 
efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) systems can be achieved through 
implementation of a Smart Micr o-Grid (Battaglini et al., 2009 ; Esmaili et al., 2006). In this 
regard, energy and power can be produced in  an efficient manner through capturing waste 
heat by using the CHP-based DERs, while environmental pollution can be reduced 
extensively by generating clea n power with the help of low-carbon DERs. Although DERs 
appear in various types and range from Micro- CHP systems based on Stirling engines, fuel 
cells and microturbines to renewable ones like solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind energy 
conversion systems (WECS) and small-scale hydroelectric generation, the choice of a 
particular DER depends strongly on the clim atic conditions, regional anatomy and fuel 
availability (Hajizadeh & Golkar, 2007 ; Hammons , 2006). Similarly, application of biofuels 
and different storage technologies such as Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 
ultra-capacitors are investigated comprehensiv ely with regard to a certain geographical 
location and some environmental constrai nts (Koeppel, 2008). Moreover, to lessen the 
greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming, most of the countries including the 
European Union(EU) and UK, are advocating  t h e  s c h e m e s  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  f u r t h e r  
exploitation of RESs as well as better inte gration of DG systems as part of the Kyoto 
protocol. Besides, with the continuous depletio n of fossil fuels as a result of growing needs 
in energy sector, most of the utilities are l ooking for non-conventional/renewable energy 
resources as an alternative.  
2.1.2. Deployment of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)  
Implementation of a Smart Grid environment w ill also facilitate the market adoption and 
accommodate all available options for better integration and interconnection of plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), as the fu ture of clean transportation systems. These 
battery-like vehicles can be used as substi tutions for conventional non-renewable energy 
sources while they can be plugged into electr ical outlets for recharging (EPRI, 2008a). In 
comparison with the current hybrid vehicles , PHEVs have different operational modes as 
well as flexibility in applications, thus they can further decrease the reliance on gasoline to 
fuel the internal combustion engines. Moreover , incorporation of PHEVs will save fuel costs, 
since they run on the equivalent of 75 cents pe r gallon or better at today’s electricity prices. 
From an environmental perspective, the deployment of PHEVs will result in a considerable 
reduction in air pollutant emissions. As an illustrative example, it was announced in 2007 by 
EPRI and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) that PHEVs will lead to a 
reduction of 3.4 to 10.3 billion metric tons of  G H G s  b y  2 0 5 0 ,  a s  a  f u n c t i o n  o f  P H E V  f l e e t  
penetration and the carbon-intensity of the electricity generation mix (EPRI, 2007a, 2007b, 
2008b). Likewise, this EPRI study revealed that  PHEVs could result in GHGs reductions of 
100 to 300 million metric tons of CO 2 per year, based on a range of planned PHEV market 
share considering the reference year of 2030.  F r o m  a  u t i l i t y  v i e w p o i n t ,  d e v e l o p m e n t  o f  
Smart Grid supports further participation of PHEV s in market actions.  The ability to charge 
PHEVs during the night with low energy price ta riffs provides operational benefits through 
improved system load factor, environmental benefits through mitigation of GHGs emissions 
and economical profits though utilization of ba se load resources. Development of a Smart  
Global Warming Mitigation  Using Smart Micro-Grids 125 
Grid makes it possible to send signals to cons umers intelligently on when to charge their 
vehicles or provide multi-tariff rates to enco urage off-peak charging. Alternatively, PHEVs 
can be used for peak-shaving or power-quality applications by storing electrical energy in 
their onboard batteries, offering potentially po werful synergies to complement the electric 
power grid. With an expert coordination am ong smart vehicles and the Smart Grid, PHEVs 
may serve as a dispersed generation system it self, providing energy efficiency, stability and 
environmental benefits for the grid operation.  C o n s i d e r i n g  t h e  a t t r i b u t e s  i n h e r e n t  i n  a  
typical PHEV, it is reasonable to a ssign some share of projected PHEV CO 2 reduction impact 
to the development of a Smart Grid. On the basi s of EPRI research studies, a portion of 10% 
to 20% can be dedicated to PHEV CO 2 reduction impact in a smart grid environment, which 
in turn reduces the net CO 2 emissions from 10 to 60 million metric tons of CO 2 in 2030. 
2.2. Impacts of Micro-Grids on atmospheric emissions and environmental issues  
Regardless of market sensitivity, renewabl e energy microsources and other low-carbon 
generation units can effectively reduce emis sions and environmental warming and this is 
one of the most important reasons to suppor t Micro-Grid design and implementation. To 
assure eco-friendly operation, the Micro-Grid  central controller (CC) should be programmed 
in a way to make optimal decisions for unit commitment based on the lowest net emission 
production, considering both displaced emission  and lo cal  em ission fro m  m icrosou rces as  
objectives. In the presence of market sensitivity, decision-making algorithms become more 
complex, because market-responsive CC should include “emission minimization” as an 
additional criterion for dispatch decisions (Chuang & McGranaghan, 2008). This complexity 
can be handled suitably provided that reasonab le and fair emission tariffs are introduced 
into the market system, i.e., the electricit y supplied from the microsources would be 
valuated through price tariffs following the net reduction in emissions is acquired. In that 
case, a measure of the net emission reduction is available from the price signals itself. 
Emission tariffs might be also established on the basis of multi-criteria functions covering 
several factors such as time, season and loca tion, so that at worst pollution times and 
locations, the tariffs would be most attractive. In such a situation, emission price tariffs are 
provided as extra input signals to the CC to dispatch microsources optimally for minimizing 
emissions (Cinar et al., 2010). It’s also worthy of note that environmental policy initiatives 
and existing regulatory guidance should be given due importance for moving toward a 
cleaner ambient. In this regard, the US Envi ronmental Protection Agency put limits on the 
amount of emissions from six air polluta nts, including: nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon 
monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb), ozone (O 3) and particulates. According to 
recent reports on environmental pollutants it’s  shown that conventional power plants and 
fossil-fuelled vehicles are the largest producers of NO x gases. Similarly, large gas turbines 
and reciprocating engines result in sufficient NO x p r o d u c t i o n  w h e n  t h e y  a r e  o p e r a t i n g  a t  
high temperature. Conversely, microturbine s and fuel cells emit lower amounts of NO x 
because of lower combustion temperatures; henc e, their application as  microsources would 
significantly reduce carbon and nitrogen compounds and total hydrocarbons (THC). 
Besides, many efforts are made at the resent time to develop combined environmental– 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 126 
economic optimization (EED) algorithms for dispatching DGs and microsources considering 
cost of operation and atmospheric emissions like NO x, SO 2, CO 2, etc., as weighted objective 
functions simultaneously (Lagorse, 2010 ; Momoh, 2009). For CHP-based microsources, 
usually heat optimization is at the head of  concern and optimization of electricity is 
observed at the second step; i.e., according to  customers’ heat requir ement, the amount of 
power production from CHP is determined. It’s nice to mention that for large-scale CHP 
systems there are many technical and environm ental constraints that must be met during 
the operation and they are mainly as follows: 
1. Demand-supply balance: at any hours of a gi ven day, the amount of heat generation 
must be equal to the heat demand. 
2. Energy efficiency: the maximum electrical po wer generated in the process should be 
used to supply the electrical loads and surplus of demand must be provided thorough 
other microsources or purchased from the market.  
3. Emissions cap: The NO x, CO 2 and SO 2 emissions must be maintained at specified limits. 
According to the importance of the optimizati on variables, shadow prices, which are used 
to quantify the importance of each variable , might be developed to provide appropriate 
weighting factors to each of the above-mentioned constraints. Such prices might be a 
function of the real-time price, the demand, th e time of use and the season. Shadow prices 
might be also defined hourly for each type of  pollutants during the operation period for 
generating both electrical and heat ener gy. All the mentioned parameters would be 
calculated and used by the Micro-Grid’s CC to arrive economically at an optimal dispatch 
solution using an iterative procedure. During the optimization process, both seasonal and 
diurnal trends and area-wise variations of emissions should be given right weighting 
factors for appropriate scheduling and controlling the operation of generators. For 
example, the amount of ozone emission is augmented in late spring and during the 
summer when ambient temperature is high. In a similar manner, peak ozone 
concentrations occur significantly downwind of emission sources, mainly due to the 
lengthy reaction times. Moreover, ozone concentration is increased in more crowded areas 
at considerable distances downwind from ur ban areas. Thus, during the warmer periods 
of times, it is wise to reduce NO x emission in or near dense populated places to decrease 
ozone formation. CHP-based microturbines, whic h play an important role in Micro-Grids, 
can effectively address the corresponding issue. Beyond the above-mentioned points, 
there are some other parameters that must  b e  p r o v i d e d  f o r  c o n t r o l l i n g  h a z a r d o u s  
pollution and mitigating global warming. Such extra information includes: fair rate 
incentives based on specific pollutant pr oduction, displaced emissions, expected 
temperature, and etc. 
2.2.1. Minimization of pollutant deposition using microsources 
As discussed in previous section, Micro-Grid is considered as a small-scale, medium or low 
voltage (MV/LV) combined heat and power (C HP) system for supplying electrical power 
and energy needs of small local loads. More th an one Micro-Grid may also be integrated to  
Global Warming Mitigation  Using Smart Micro-Grids 127 
constitute power parks for supplying larger load  demands. In this regard, the microsources 
inside a typical Micro-Grid serve as primar y means of energy producers while they are 
using diverse types of low-carb on generation technologies. As  an example, combined heat 
and power (CHP) system is a popular kind of DER useful for Micro-Grid applications. Such 
cogeneration system has the advantage of ener gy-efficient power generation via utilization 
of waste heat (see Fig. 4).  
 
Figure 4.  Combined Heat & Power (CHP) system 
Unlike fossil-fuelled generation units, CHP-base d generators capture and use the waste heat 
for industrial processes or other local heating purposes. Moreover, the heat reproduced at 
moderate temperatures (100–180 oC) can also be used in absorption chillers for cooling 
mechanism. In this way, a CHP system can potent ially reach an efficiency of more than 80%, 
compared with that of about 35% for convention al power plants. The e fficiency can be even 
more when the heat is used locally, in other words, if the produced heat is transmitted over 
long distances for supplying remote thermal loads,  not only the overall efficiency reduces, but 
also the net operating cost and emission incr eases. On the other ha nd, because of lower 
electrical loss, CHP plants can be situated somewhere faraway from electrical loads and their 
produced energy can be transmitted over much long er distances, however, it should be kept in 
mind that such systems must alwa ys be located close to the heat loads for better efficiency and 
performance (Pecas Lopes et al., 2007). On the whole, it has been found that application of 
CHP micro-energy source yields a reduction of 35% in primary energy use in comparison with 
conventional power plants and heat-only boilers,  3 0 %  r e du c t i o n  in  e m i s s i o n  w it h  r e sp e c t  t o  
coal-fired power plants and 10% reduction in em ission with respect to combined cycle gas-
turbine plants. In addition to CHP-based syst ems, microturbines are also small and simple-
cycle gas turbines that are used extensively in Micro-Grids and ranged typically from 25 to 300 
kW based on the output power (Saha et al., 2008). Actually, microturbines have several 
advantages and inherent technologies that  are briefly include: recuperation, low NO x emission 
technology and advanced material usage su ch as ceramic for the hot section parts. 
Microturbines have also variou s structural and operational features as shown in Fig. 5. 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 128 
 
Figure 5.  Schematic of a microturbine 
From a structural prospective, they are relati vely smaller in size as compared to other 
DERs, have simpler installation procedure and lower level of noise and vibrations. They 
also have the capability of using alternative fuels, like natural gas, diesel, ethanol and 
landfill gas, and other biomass-derived liquids and gases. From an operational viewpoint it 
can be said that, microturbines are designed  for 11,000 hours of operation between major 
overhauls with a service life of at least 45,000 hours. Total cost of such system is lower than 
$500 per kW which is competitive with altern atives including grid power for market 
applications. They can also reach the range of  25–30% in fuel-to-electricity conversion rate 
while the energy efficiency level can be greater than 80% if the waste heat recovery is used 
for CHP applications. In addition, microturbines participate actively in clean air action by 
producing reduced amounts of NO x emissions which are lower than 7 ppm for natural gas 
machines. As a matter of fact, the net emission belongs to a microturbine greatly depends 
on its operating temperature, power output and the control of the combustion process, 
therefore it can be minimized only through qu ick and accurate control of the combustion 
process which is done suitably by the microturbine’s internal control system. On the other 
hand, the central controll er of the Micro-Grid ( ΐcc) may only provide the generation set 
points for the microturbine considering the net emission production in relation with power 
level and displaced emissions for both heat and electric power output. The CC may also 
monitor the remaining oxygen concentration in  t h e  e n g i n e  e x h a u s t  f o r  s o m e  p a r t i c u l a r  
applications. In order to minimize NO x e m i s s i o n ,  m i c r o t u r b i n e  m a n u f a c t u r e r s  u s u a l l y  
apply various controlling algorithms along with some combustion control methods. For 
instance, wet diluent injection (WDI) is a controlling approach for NO x r e d u c t i o n  i n  
microturbines where water or steam is injected  into the combustion zone to moderate the 
temperature, however, this method increases CO 2 p r o d u c t i o n ,  r e d u c e s  e f f i c i e n c y  a n d  
shortens equipment life.  
Another type for microsources is  regarded as fuel cell (FC) wh ich converts chemical energy 
of a fuel into electrical energy directly (Fig. 6). Basically, it consists of two electrodes with 
different polarities and an electrolyte that di ssociates fully or partially into ions when 
dissolved in a solvent, producing a solution that conducts electricity.  
 
Global Warming Mitigation Using Smart Micro-Grids 129 
 
Figure 6.  Schematic of a Hydrogen FC 
From an operational prospective, the FC is ve ry similar to a storage battery, however, the 
reactants and products are not stored, but ar e continuously fed into the cell. During 
operation, the hydrogen-rich fuel  is fed to the anode and the oxidant which is usually air is 
conducted toward the cathode separately. Through an electrochemical oxidation and 
reduction process, electricity, as the main output, is produced  at the electrodes while heat 
and water are produced as by-products. Comp ared to conventional generators, FCs have 
several advantages. First, they are very clean means of energy production and serves as eco-
friendly sources of energy. Because of their higher efficiency and lower fuel oxidation 
temperature, they emit  lower amounts of CO 2 and NO x per kilowatt of output power. Due 
to the absence of any rotating parts in FCs’ structures, they are robu st, low maintenance and 
almost free from noise and vibration. Moreover, they can run with different kinds of fuels 
like natural gas, propane, landfill gas, anaerobi c digester gas, diesel, naphtha, methanol and 
hydrogen, therefore, this technology will no t become obsolete due to versatility of 
consuming fuels or unavailability of ener gy resources. Apart from the mentioned 
microsources, solar photovoltaic (PV) is anothe r kind of DER that helps the minimization of 
pollutants deposition by generating electricit y from solar energy. PV systems have several 
advantages over the conventional genera tors as are stated in the following: 
1. Inexhaustible , clean and free nature of solar energy, 
2. Minimum environmental impact, 
3. Lower customers’ electricity bills due to free availability of sunlight, 
4. Long operational lifetime of over 30 years with minimum maintenance, 
5. Noiseless operation 
Owing to the above benefits, it’s found that to day’s PV systems not only have the potential 
to supply a big portion of the world’s energy needs in a sustainable and renewable manner, 
but also have the capability to reduce environmental footprints.  
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 130 
3. Technical, economical and environmental advantages of  
Smart Micro-Grids 
It has explained earlier that effective utilization of waste heat in CHP-based microsources 
is one of the potential benefits of a Smart Mi cro-Grid. Besides, good  coordination between 
heat generation and efficient heat utilization is a requisite task for energy optimization in 
Smart Micro-Grids that can be achieved by using heat generation control and thermal 
process control features in Smart Central Cont roller (SCC). Process optimization functions 
can also be built in the SCC to increase overall system efficiency and reliability (Molderink 
et al., 2009; Venayagamoorthy, 2009). On the ot her hand, Smart Micro-Grid has the ability 
to affect electricity and gas markets significantly, when its share of market participation is 
encouraged. In this regard, insightful mark et reforms must be made to allow active 
participation, while good financial incentives should be provided for owners to invest in 
Smart Micro-Grids. Once market participation is assured, Smart Micro-Grids can 
effectively supply quality services for distribution systems as well as ancillary services for 
the utilities. Similarly, with rising co ncern for global warming and environmental 
pollution, most countries are focusing on utilizing eco-friendly plants with low-carbon 
generators and trying to reduce their emissi on levels by 50% as per the Kyoto Protocol, 
considering the reference year of 2050. Rega rding this planning horizon, Smart Micro-
Grids together with cleaner microsources and RE Ss, strongly have the ability to reduce the 
overall environmental impact caused by existing infrastructures. To fulfill the clean air 
action, SCCs must be also programmed in a way to make smart dispatch decisions for DGs 
considering pollution level caused by the ne t emission in the locality (Figueiredo & 
Martins, 2010). Likewise, to give due importan ce and authority to Smart Micro-Grids that 
would help to mitigate the net greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate emissions in the 
environment, rules and regulations must be made subsequently. On the whole, 
development of Smart Micro-Grid is very pr omising for the electr ic energy industry 
because of the following advantages: 
x Environmental benefits –  Smart Micro-Grids can reduce gaseous and particulate 
emissions and help to mitigate global warming through incorporation of low-carbon 
RESs together with close control of the comb ustion process. Moreover, local distribution 
of microsources and physical proximity of them with loads and consumers may help to 
increase the awareness of customer s towards judicious energy usage. 
x Economical benefits –  Smart Micro-Grids can also end in  cost savings in multiple ways: 
first, significant savings may be achieved fr om utilization of waste heat in CHP mode of 
operation. Second, no considerable and costly  i n f r a s t r u c t u r e  i s  r e q u i r e d  f o r  h e a t  a n d  
power transmission as the microsources are physically situated close to the customer 
loads. This way of energy pr oduction gives a total energy efficiency of more than 80% 
as compared to a maximum of 40% for conventional power systems. Third, substantial 
cost savings can be obtained through integration of several microsources and 
construction of clean energy farms. Since each  i n d i v i d u a l  f a r m  i s  l o c a l l y  o p e r a t e d  i n  
plug-and-play mode, the transmission and distribution (T&D) costs are drastically 
reduced or eliminated. Moreover, expert combination of such energy farms into a  
Global Warming Mitigation  Using Smart Micro-Grids 131 
unified Smart Micro-Grid can contribute to further cost reduction not only through 
eliminating the need for energy exchange with  the main grid over longer transmission 
lines, but also by sharing the generated electricity among the local customers. 
x Technical benefits –  F r o m  a  t e c h n i c a l  p r o s p e c t i v e ,  implementation of Smart Micro-
Grids can be beneficial for both utilities and customers. The voltage profile is enhanced 
through better supply of reactive power for local inductive loads and the whole system 
as well. The congestions on transmission an d distribution feeders are also reduced. 
Moreover, since a Smart Micro-Grid has a sens e of detection to understand where it is 
loaded beyond capacity, thus it has the ability to reroute power to lessen overload and 
impede potential outages. In a similar manne r, T&D losses can be cut down to about 3% 
by generating electricity near the load cent ers while the investments in the expansion of 
transmission and generation systems can be  r e d u c e d  o r  p o s t p o n e d  b y  p r o p e r  a s s e t  
management. Due to decentralization of supply and better load feeding, reduction of 
large-scale transmission and generation outages, minimization of downtimes and 
enhancement of the restoration process throug h black start operations of microsources, 
power quality and reliability is enhanced consequently.  
It’s also noticeable that in the case of mark et participation, additional advantages can be 
achieved by Smart Micro-Grids which are mainly as follows: 
x Market power mitigation -  T h e  g r i d - c o n n e c t e d  o p e r a t i o n  o f  S m a r t  M i c r o - G r i d s  i n  a  
market-based environment will lead to a significant reduction of market power exerted 
by the large dominant GenCos or through collusion of some market participants. 
x Market price reduction -  Widespread exploitation of RESs together with application of 
low-cost plug-and-play microsources may result  in a reduction in energy price tariffs in 
the power market. 
x Ancillary services (AS) -  The Smart Micro-Grids may also be used to supply ancillary 
services such as frequency control or spinning reserve provision. 
x Long-term cost reduction -  The long-term electricity custom er prices can be reduced by 
about 10% through appropriate economic ba lance between network investment and DG 
utilization. 
4. Conclusion 
Energy management systems and power system optimizers accompanied by integration of 
renewable energy resources and adoption of PHEVs which form a whole Smart Micro-Grid 
vision, are parts of an integrated approach  t o  m i t i g a t e  g l o b a l  w a r m i n g  a n d  h a v e  t h e  
capability of serving as a basic tool to reach energy independence and climate change 
objectives. In this regard, energy efficiency  m e c h a n i s m s  a r e  p o t e n t i a l l y  t h e  m o s t  c o s t -
effective, short-term options to reduce ca rbon emissions compared to other abatement 
alternatives. Moreover, energy-efficient a pproaches reduce GHG emissions not only 
through energy savings but also  t h r o u g h  t h e  d e f e r r a l  o f  n e w  g e n e r a t i o n  w i t h  t h e  h e l p  o f  
technological advancements on the supply-side . In this sense, the more deferral of new 
generation by means of energy efficiency measures, results the more free time dedicated to  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 132 
improvements in bringing cleaner and more e fficient generation online, thereby providing a 
bridge between the present and a carbon-constrained future.  
On the other hand, an intelligent grid can lead to a revolution in power system operation, a 
revolution that will take place if new idea s and technologies along with very large 
penetrations of renewable energies are to be incorporated onto the grid. However, in order 
to efficiently operate and make good decision s, a Smart Micro-Grid must have information 
feeding supervisory control unit and Smart Energy Management System (SEMS). This 
information can be used to create better procedures and capabilities for the Smart Micro-
Grid and allow more prudent investments. The optimal integration of decentralized energy 
storages will be also an extremely important task in the near future for the utilities. 
Moreover, to reach a pathway toward intelligent structures, first the barriers must be 
identified and then research, development and demonstrations of operation must be 
conducted to overcome these barriers.

1. Introduction 
Climate change has become undeniably one of the most important challenges for our 
generation and the ones that follow. This challe nge is such that it affects the whole of our 
space-time spectrum: an urgent reassessment of our present-day technology is indisputably 
needed, while at the same time, this challenge also requires the most accurate knowledge of 
the shifts in temperature in the hope for a po ssible and still hypothetical sustainable future. 
Not only this, but it will also concern – and alre ady does – the totality of the planet and of its 
living creatures. The problem that climate change  represents is therefore very wide and has 
an effect on a very broad rang e of human activities. However, in spite of the importance of 
the historical and global parameters, it appears as if the cause of the rise in temperature of 
our planet is first and foremost technological (because of man-made carbon emissions) and 
that a technological solution would consequently be needed. 
After all, within the history of technology and science, every once in a while, a notable 
breakthrough allows for the betterment of the human condition. Agriculture, electricity, 
steam engines, atomic science, biotechnology, etc., mark our timeline. These breakthroughs 
have enriched the life of many, for the sake of ‘human’ needs, complementing rather than 
overcoming the previous techniques and tec hnologies. An example of this complementary 
use is the ‘Green Revolution’ in which mechan ised agriculture played a major role in the 
1960s to the 1990s, and that even saw countries such as Mexico overpr oducing and therefore 
exporting some new types of wheat. Thes e past and contemporary techniques and 
technologies therefore play a major role in easi ng our lives. It would therefore be logical to 
await for the next techno-scientific gene ration to revolutionize our routines.  
Indeed, the question left unanswered to day is the following: what technological 
breakthrough will come next that will se rve our energy needs? Nanotechnology and  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 138 
biotechnology holds no promise of energy qua lity or sustainable energy as much as 
hydrogen fuel is not yet ready for takeoff and probably needs more investment. Another 
techno-scientific revolution is therefore greatly expected. Yet, let’s imagine for an instant, 
let’s put forward the fantastic hypothesis that  a  s o l u t i o n  t o  t h e  p r o d u c t i o n  o f  g r e e n h o u s e  
gases has been found, that hydrogen fuel beco mes affordable and marketable, that wind and 
solar energy can be stored, even on the scale of our planet. The problem at the origin of 
global warming would probably be resolved. But would the core of the problem be really 
solved, the one of the misuse of technology itself? 
Alongside the succession of technological innovations, we also have to acknowledge the 
succession of catastrophes, disasters and accide nts that constitute our modern history and 
that are as important to underscore as the techno-scientific progresses themselves. 
Fukushima, Chernobyl, as the most devastating technological accidents, as much as the 
most inhuman misuse of science in warfare st rategies, such as the gas chambers and the 
atomic bombings. The binary use of science and technology is evident, even today, within 
the continuous use of weapons around the wo rld, the on-going oil spillages, the endless 
industrial pollution of all types and the unce rtainties concerning the safest way to store 
radioactive waste for the coming thousands of years. 
The binary aspect of technology is in fact recurrent, in its misuse, as much as in human’s 
unstable control over nature and even over  the technological apparatuses themselves. 
Consequently, even if we find a technological solution to the present state of the Earth and 
to the production of greenhouse gases, will the problem of the misuse of technology as such 
be solved? This mishandling and dual use is persistent, as we will detail in this essay, and 
needs an appropriate framing. In deed, what tells us that this misuse will cease to happen 
once global warming no longer constitutes a th reat to living beings and that another threat 
will not be in sight in the remote future?  
Our current situation therefore needs to be tackled ontologica lly – that is, to think and 
underscore the origin  of the problem and of this misuse at large. Through this approach, and 
by way of consequences, this essay will stand in  the domain of the humanities. The strategy 
is to understand global warming beyond (and complementary to) the scientific challenge 
that it represents in the world today. As un expected as it may seem, the humanities have 
already dedicated much thinking to similar pr oblems and these thoughts are as crucial to 
consider today as they were yesterday – for we  need to think about global warming from all 
possible angles. This essay will adopt existing  t h e o r e t i c a l ,  p h i l o s o p h i c a l  a n d  a r t i s t i c  
frameworks to investigate global warming.  T h e s e  f r a m e w o r k s  w i l l  p e r m i t  t a c k l i n g  t h e  
current crisis from a wide variety of angles, such as the recurrence of apocalyptical 
scenarios, the emergence of the so-called ‘clima te-sceptics’, the absolute urgency to revise 
the Western project of modernity and the diffi culty in reaching a universal agreement to 
resolve the problem. Scientific research pr ogressed rapidly in the past century and a 
similarly emphasis on the development of thin king in the humanities is now needed, since 
this will help in considering possible ways out from the current situation.  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications

2. Of the modern technologies and the technology of destruction: 
apocalyptical thinking 
Even though an expertise is undeniably needed in this domain, it does not however require 
complex techno-scientific knowledge to unders tand the consequence of climate change: the 
misuse or excessive use of modern technology can lead to the destruction of the world – or 
at least to the destruction of its species and/or resources necessary for their survival, and this 
destruction is in sight. The problem of global warming can indeed be characterized very 
straightforwardly in such a form for now, by the destruction of our ecosystem. It is this 
simple yet frightening prediction that will constitute our starting point. This aspect is indeed 
very prominent, so much so that the term  ‘ t h e r m a g e d d o n ’  h a s  e v e n  b e e n  c o i n e d ,  f o r  
instance by Greenpeace cofounder Robert Hunter.[1]  
According to Hunter, and as he argued in Thermageddon, Countdown to 2030, the negative 
effect of the change in climate of our Earth will culminate in the year  2030, where the ice cap 
will have completely melted, with the result  o f  u n p r e c e d e n t e d  c l i m a t i c  d i s a s t e r s  –  t h e  
countdown is starting. Yet we must acknowledg e here the recurrence of such apocalyptical 
endings. It is not the first time that humanity has been considered to be on the verge of total 
extinction: nuclear physicists wa rned us with their ‘doomsday clock’ as early as the 1940s 
after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We must therefore argue here, like the 
French philosopher Jacques Derrida did before  u s  i n  t h e  c a s e  o f  n u c l e a r  w e a p o n r y ,  t h e  
extent to which this all too human capacity of self-destruction is not new. Here is our first 
clue towards the framing of the current proble m: the previous debates on weapons of mass 
destruction. 
In No Apocalypse Not Now , Derrida argued in the 1980s that the post-war and Cold War 
anxiety of nuclear apocalypse and its hypothetic al total annihilation was nothing new. As he 
stated: “One may still die after having spent one’ s life recognizing as lucid historian, to what 
extend all that was not new (…). One always di e, humanity might well not escape the rule.” 
[2] It is indeed human’s finitude that is at stake in these debates over human’s technological 
destruction of the environment, be it throug h nuclear warfare or emission of greenhouse 
gases. In the face of these repeated catacl ysmic circumstances, one can even suspect the 
inheritance of religious believes, like German philosopher Günter Anders did. In the 1960s, 
Anders defined the fear for a nuclear apocal ypse as a modern form of the Christian 
eschatology.[3] For Anders, the modern man re -created for himself the condition of the 
Christian apocalypse, when the believers awaite d (and still are) for the last judgment, yet 
without the possibility of salvation that th e Christian apocalypse envisioned. Global 
warming is consequently not the first time in which the end of our species or of our world 
has been discussed – and probably not the last either, given that space scientists are already 
planning the extinction of the sun in a few billion years from now.  
This recurrence was also notably detected by Maurice Blanchot, another French philosopher, 
who pushed the argument even further as to state the lack of modernity of this nuclear 
apocalypse. In The Apocalypse is Disappointing , Blanchot asserted that  the nuclear apocalypse, 
or rather the atomic terror, is in fact “a pret ence”, since, according to him, “what one is  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 140 
looking for is not a new way of thinking but a way to consolidate old predicaments. (…) it 
becomes clear that humanity will continue to run around old values, be it for all eternity.”[4] 
Newness was one of modernity’s leading criteria  yet, as Blanchot pointed out, the modern 
apocalypse is merely a new way to restate ancestral fears and issues. Technological 
annihilation is therefore a recurrent problem, it actually is a  t e c h n o l o g y  i n  i t s e l f ,  a  
technology of destruction – the only difference being that nuclear apocalypse could have 
been (and can still be) triggered by the rulin g class and the scientific-military cast, whereas 
the mass of Earth’s citizens participates in the production of greenhouse gases, yet with no 
direct intention to kill anybody. Yet, to cut loose with this repeated anxiety of cataclysmic 
ending, we can also put forward the surprising  argument, like Maurice Blanchot strikingly 
did before us with regard to the fear of nuclea r annihilation, that even if this tipping point 
occurs, the span of its destruction will in fact  be limited. According to Blanchot, even if it 
happened, the nuclear apocalypse would be “wea k”[5], for it would damage our planet only 
and our personal universes, but it would never di srupt the rest of the co urse of the universe 
itself, that is, the whole universe.  
Pushing this claim forward should not howeve r become an excuse to avoid the imminence 
of the current crisis. To come back to our hu man scale, we also need to acknowledge, like 
Derrida did before us for nuclear warfare, that  the two hypothetical and/or tangible events 
proceed from a process of dissociation , even if in different fashions. For Derrida, nuclear 
weapons intensified a dissociation of competen ces, when scientists and military men find 
themselves in the position of taking the final decision, within a situation whose uniqueness 
would be to have no pre-existing pattern, rend ering difficult any expertise in the matter. Not 
only this, but in this hypothet ical situation, the fate of many, of humankind and all living 
species, would be left in the hands of a few people, which precisely unravel here again any 
competency in the matter. As for climate chan ge,the emphasis is on dissociation, yet a 
different one, the one dissociating the ancestral ‘cause-effect’ relationship itself. To give an 
arbitrary example, the effect of using a car in any place in the world does not directly affect 
the life of the driver, but the wh ole of the planet and, most importantly, in a differed and 
uncertain future. The dissociation  is here dramatically obvious,  even though every citizen of 
Earth does not equally participate in the ca use of the current problem. More than a 
dissociation, global warming also includes a mechanism of individualism and indifference 
or guilt, once the awareness of the long-term effect of human pollution is acquired. Most 
drivers still use their car as they did ten to twen ty years ago, in spite of the regular increases 
in expenses that this mode of locomotion imp lies. As Robert Hunter described, it still is a 
way of life, or at least for some in the West, while for others, it is merely a necessity, since 
the functioning of most societies is still based on fossil fuels.  
Once again, however, this mechanism of dissoci ation, in this form, is nothing new. In the 
context of the use of napalm gas by the Unit ed States during the Vietnam War, the German 
filmmaker Harun Farocki framed this ph enomenon in his fictional documentary  
Inextinguishable Fire  (1969). The dissociation is suggested within the distance between factory 
workers and their final products, when the empl oyees pictured do not know if they produce 
vacuum cleaners or some sort of specific weapons, whose effect they do not fully  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 141 
understand. While at the same time, the scientist s are depicted as completely detached from 
reality, testing and discussing the effectiveness of  napalm gas onto flies in a cold and clinical 
fashion. This dissociation, which adds to the di ssociation of the ‘cause-effect’ relationship, 
was and still is the underlining theme of past and contemporary Western narratives, such as 
the notorious and fantastic Faust  (1808) by Goethe, Frankenstein  (1818)by Mary Shelley, and 
closer to us, the non-less fantastic opera Dr Atomic  (2005) by John Adams. These narratives 
are of importance here as th ey underscore, by their popu larity, the repeated concern 
towards science’s doings.  
In Dr Atomic , the physicist Robert Oppenheimer is depicted as taking an active role in 
convincing the American militaries to use the atomic bomb, because the bomb would have a 
unique effect that he qualifies in terms of iridizing luminescence and optimal 
dangerousness; while in Goethe’s Faust , the erudite doctor who was in the search for the 
meaning of life and limitless knowledge, lets himself be taken by the irrationality of a 
supernatural phenomenon, to th e point of opening his door to the disguised Devil, and 
therefore, to his perdition (Fig. 1). These na rratives are indeed quite famously paradigmatic 
of such doubts in human betterment via modern  scientific means, in today’s world as much 
as at the time of the second Indust rial Revolution – although Goethe’s Faust  was based on 
legends that were already popular in the sixteenth  century, that is befo re the first Industrial 
Revolution, but the latter had a rather religious  moralistic stance more than anything else.  
 
Figure 1.  Rembrandt, Faust , dry-point, etching and engraving with punch, 208x160cm, Rijksmuseum 
Amsterdam, 1650-1652. 
Whereas both narratives are nonetheless very di fferent in context and aims, the importance 
of these portrayals lies not solely in their unquestionable popularity, but also in their 
recurrence, for they reflect the reality of an on-going anxiety in the face of the 
malfunctioning of our interaction with nature and our technological apparatuses. This 
dissociation, between the scientist’s research and its actual application or even the reality of 
the world, is therefore not new, and is also to be added to the already existing binary 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 142 
characteristic of the use of technology that we already mentioned in the introduction. One 
has not to forget that contemporary to Goethe  and Shelley was Jules Verne for example, who 
was also famously known for all the enchanting technological devices that populated his 
science-fiction novels. This type of  rather enthusiastic stance is still detectable today. Even 
out of the literary circles, scientists like the post-war quantum physic ist Werner Heisenberg 
enthusiastically stated how modern technology would overcome the entire planet, while the 
contemporary French philosopher Paul Virilio even envisioned a total disembodiment of the 
mind thanks to advanced technology, where a ‘scopic’ mind would be able to travel to the 
other end of the universe. The dual use of th e technology was therefore as present in the 
past as it is today. 
With these mechanisms of self-destruction, of  d i s s o c i a t i o n  ( o f  t h e  r e l a t i o n  b e t w e e n  c a u s e  
and effect) and with the binary aspect of the technological apparatus so far, we consequently 
have to acknowledge here the ways in which th e threat of total annihilation that climate 
change represents today is nothing new. The ai m of this essay is however not to speculate 
and theorize on the possible destruction of th e human species’ biosphere nor on the endless 
eschatological endings. To focus solely on the technology of destruction would be to 
disregard the core of the problem: the econ omic stakes relating to techno-scientific 
applications. Other characteristics of global warming consequently need to be underscored 
here. 
3. Of believers, sceptics and entrepreneurs 
Another unavoidable characteristic of global  w a r m i n g  t h a t  p a r t i c u l a r l y  n e e d s  t o  b e  
addressed here is the fact that  t h i s  p h e n o m e n o n  i s  c o n t e s t e d .  T h e r e  i s  i n d e e d  a n  o n g o i n g  
debate between those asserting the existence of  climate change, and the others, the ‘climate-
sceptics’ or ‘non-believers’. Here too, this binary opposition must be underscored as a 
recurrence, for it echoes once again the Cold War debates between those fearing and 
wanting to prevent the advent of a nuclear ap ocalypse, and the others, those believing that 
the human species will never been wiped off the surface of the Earth.  
Not only this, but before its relation to economic interests, our current divide is nevertheless 
interesting in many ways, one of which bein g rhetorical: Derrida already pointed out how 
nuclear weapons generated their own rhetoric , of ‘dissuasion’ and ‘deterrence’, while 
climate change has clearly created a new set of  vocabulary, distinguishing for example the 
‘climate-sceptics’ from the others, that the scepti cs strategically call ‘the alarmists’. Even the 
term ‘thermageddon’, that we already noted, pert ains to this rhetorical characteristic that 
goes far toward generating terms such as ‘ecocide’, to name the consequence of series of 
actual (and incontestable) devastating phenomenon, which in today’s world is 
unfortunately became a banality. The term was recently put into strategic use by 
campaigners in the United Kingdom in an atte mpt to have it recognized by the United 
Nations as a fifth “crime against peace.”[6] In dustrialists that are polluting, as much as 
“climate deniers” [7], would be liable in front of  the International Criminal Court, for acts as 
much as for words. Such a term is paradigmati c of our modern times and reflects a reality  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 143 
difficult to deny – a reality that therefore goes  beyond the rhetorical condition that nuclear 
warfare generated.  
A second interesting specificity of this divide, between the climate-sceptics and the others, is 
that it does not engage the scientific commun ity alone. Indeed, this particular condition 
becomes quickly obvious after reading a series of press articles on the topic, and goes to its 
paroxysm when newspapers themselves, that are supposed to be reporting current events in 
an objective fashion, come to accuse one anothe r of belonging to one category or the other, 
therefore slipping into the binary distinction.  For example, the recent article published in 
February 2012 by the Guardian , titled ‘ Wall Street Journal  rapped over climate change stance’, 
is paradigmatic of this ongoing discussion – the Guardian  accusing the Wall Street Journal of 
repeated bias towards, or rather, of holding a ‘sceptic’ position on climate change, via the 
stance of journalists and scientists. 
Further on, the Guardian ’s article however holds another re presentative characteristic, not 
simply of global warming alone, but of the misuse of technology at large: the economic 
stakes that advanced technology represents. To be more specific, the article was in the form 
of a letter, published by climate change experts, against the one published by the Wall Street 
Journal  that was signed by a community of scientists expressing their scepticism. However, 
as the Guardian  article pointed out quite clearly, almost half of the ‘non-believer’ scientists 
worked, more or less directly, for international corporations such as Exxon. Economic stakes 
and the search for benefits, on the side of co rporations as much as  o f  i n d i v i d u a l s ,  a r e  
obvious here. Here is another clue to help in analysing our current problem, and that leads 
to our initial assertion, that the origin to prob lems such as climate change is not essentially 
technological. 
Entrepreneurs play a significant role in our situation, with the complicity or resistance of the 
scientists and/or government, and this state of affairs is, once again, not a novelty. One of 
the most striking and obvious examples, that dates from the 1970s and 1980s, is the 
insistence of the physiologist Hans Jürgen Ey senck giving credit to cigarettes, amidst the 
growing critics against the effects of nicotine at that time. His research was funded in the 
majority by the American tobacco industry. [8] To list such inst ances, of the interference of 
entrepreneurs and politicians in scientific re search, would in fact be endless. Yet, 
historically, they can be traced back to the famous and popular extortion of Galileo’s 
recantation by the Roman Inquisition – since th e interests at stake are not always directly 
economic and can even be ideological. Anothe r notorious historical example is Napoleon 
Bonaparte’s war in Egypt. Napoleon employed more than a hundred fifty scientists and 
scholars during his imperialist war in Egypt th at he initiated in the late 1790s to compete 
with the British Empire. Under the cover of rea lizing the ideals of the Enlightenment – that 
had the hope of archiving knowledge for a better understanding of our world and for 
possible betterment of our human condition – Napoleon covered his imperialist moves 
using propaganda, aided by scholars and interp rets, going as far as to declare to the 
Egyptians that he encountered: “Nous somme s les vrais musulmans” (we are the true 
Muslims). [9]   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 144 
The practical and ideological use of scientists, which took an infamously odious turn under 
the Third Reich, is therefore no thing new. This use is not always unidirectional, since some 
scientists themselves interfere with political matters, such as Einstein, who sent numerous 
letters to the American president Roosevelt in  o r d e r  t o  p e r s u a d e  h i m  t o  s t a r t  a  n u c l e a r  
military programme, in the eventuality that th e Germans invented the atomic bomb first. 
Since the appearance of the profession of scie ntist itself there have always been embedded 
scientists, along with scientific resistance to ideological stakes. It must be said, however, that 
their activities are not the only activities to be targeted by political or economic interests 
since, as a parenthesis, artists are inevitably caught in similar situations. [10] Some artists 
were also counted among the team of schola rs that Napoleon brought to Egypt. [10]. 
To come back to the misuse of technology, this particular phenomenon has already been 
analysed in the post-war and Cold War co ntext by the German philosopher Martin 
Heidegger. In an attempt at shedding ligh t to the essence of technology, Heidegger 
characterized it not simply as ‘a means to an  end’ when, to use his example, a Christian 
ritual requires the crafting of  a  c h a l i c e .  I n  i t s  p l a c e ,  a n d  in his phenomenological way, 
Heidegger rather defined technology as a ‘revea ling’, thanks to which nature would appear 
in particular ways to us, through technological apparatuses. Yet within this revealing lies a 
danger, according to Heidegger, as the essence of technology is also an “Enframing,”[11] or 
a Gestell as he called it, when men ( dasein ) thought they were harn essing nature, but find 
themselves challenged instead of mastering it. Here is an important claim that is still 
relevant today. Yet, for He idegger, there is a major difference in between modern 
technology and the previous form of craft/technology, and this difference is of importance 
for our relation to technology, or more im portantly, for our relation to nature.  
It would seem, according to the philosopher, that  nature has been put at our disposal when, 
in the case of a hydroelectric power station for example, “even the Rhine appears at our 
command.”[12] Yet Heidegger’s most striking cr itique of modern technology is that human 
interaction with nature is based on prospects of  productivity, turning it into a mere stock or 
“standing-reserve”[13] as he calls it. As he st ated: “Agriculture is now the mechanized food 
industry. Air is now set upon to  yield nitrogen, the earth to yi eld ore, ore to yield uranium, 
for example; uranium is set upon to yield atom ic energy, which can be unleashed either for 
destructive or for peaceful pu rposes.”[14] This is the major difference between the pre-
modern and modern technologies, according to him: a windmill does not store energy, 
whereas modern technology does. We must note he re that Derrida, in his analysis of nuclear 
warfare, also underlined the race for stockp iling, that he even characterized as being 
capitalist, since this accumulation cons titutes for him “the very movement of 
capitalization.”[15] If Heidegger and Derrida’s statements date respectively of the 1960s and 
1980s, one must admit that today’s technological interaction with nature has barely changed. 
Nature has to be generous, productive and di rected toward human needs, but is put at 
unreasonable  use, as Heidegger al ready underscored. It is well this unreasonable use that is 
problematic more than the need for stocking – a problem yet unsolved but of crucial 
importance in order to face the upcoming challenges such as global warming. The financial 
benefits that are at stake for the big energy groups are indeed too big to be re-centred  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 145 
towards a better understanding and use of the resources of the planet. This technological 
‘Enframing’ therefore remains even today. 
Ontologically, the problem of the misuse of tech nology is consequently not technological, as 
Heidegger already clearly defined the essence of modern technology as not b e i n g  
technological. As we just showed, the essence of  technology is a revealing. The main issue to 
solve is the way it is handled. This is wh at is challenging for humans – and the most 
prominent aspect of the problem to solve today. Yet as Heidegger clearly stated with regard to 
this enframing, within the technological revea ling, as much as danger lies, also lies the 
possibility of a certain form of “freedom,” [16] fo r the fact that the misuse of technology is not 
humans’ fate. There is, and must be, a possibility of  salvation, if humans realize that they are, 
as he phrased it, the “one[s] spoken to” [17] by nature and not the other way around. 
Consequently, we could imagine a new techno-scientific device that would be efficient 
enough to stop the production  of greenhouse gases, we could imagine finding a new source 
of energy, a new fuel, but would this stop ideological and economic stakes? Ethics, in 
science, politics, art or any social activities, co nsequently constitute one key to resolving the 
problem. Yet to go further into finding the orig in of our present situation, and in order to 
find a solution, we have now to acknowledge that these social disciplines, science, art, 
politics, are in the West components of or fuel for a larger project: the project of modernity, 
and this project is equally important to cons ider as it will help further in framing the 
recurrent misuse of techno-scientific devices, and show that, again, the source of the 
problem is not solely technological. 
4. Modernity, technology and domination 
Our relation to nature is therefore to be me ticulously rethought and needs to be analysed 
further. Such a task cannot be avoided. Another characteristic of climate change, more subtle 
than the ones we just considered so far, is that it indeed is modern  t e c h n o l o g y ,  o r  r a t h e r ,  
modernity at large, that is at stake, which we only hinted at with Heidegger. There is indeed 
a more or less direct link between climate change and the advent of modernity and its 
spread around the world. In We Never Have Been Modern , French philosopher of science 
Bruno Latour explained the specificity of this relation, simply by showing the importance he 
sees, specifically, in the year 1989.  
Within the moment of the fall of the Berlin wa ll, at the very moment when the West exulted 
at the victory of capitalism and liberalis m over communism, came the first major 
conferences on global warming. As he stated: “In Paris, London and Amsterdam, this same 
glorious year 1989 witnesses the first conference s on the global state of the planet: for some 
observers they symbolize the end of capitalism and its vain hopes of unlimited conquest and 
total dominion over nature.”[18] Climate ch ange therefore shows the limits of such a 
system, the modern and capitalist system. 
Yet for Latour, global warming is rather a symbol, of the malfunctioning of modernity. What 
is of prime importance for him is that the pr ecepts of modernity themselves need to be  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 146 
revised and this is an urgent necessity. No t simply because of the consequences of the 
change in temperature of the planet, but al so and mainly because developing countries 
inherit the Western modern ideals and that these ideals are partly deficient – or rather, they 
need to be revised and re-adjusted. First and foremost, we must note that Latour asserted 
his argument in the 1990s. In today’s world ho wever, modern technology is no longer the 
prerogative of the West alone. India has it s space and nuclear programme, China its bullet 
train, and South Korea its nuclear programme for example. Yet the question of inheritance is 
of prime importance, for the reas on that some of the precepts of modernity are faulty, as 
Latour argued, and we consequently n eed to underline these deficiencies. 
For Latour, one of the major problems (that Heid egger also revealed be fore Latour), is the 
modern relation to nature, which is of major significance, beyond and in addition to the 
global economic stakes that we already underscore d. This relation to nature is detectable in 
the West in a twofold movement: the first move ment is the way in which modernity initially 
thought its relation to nature as completely ne w, because it separated the ‘subject’ from the 
‘object’ – a typically modern ch aracteristic, to which Latour ga ve attention. While the second 
movement saw this supposedly new relation to nature in terms of domination , as we will 
detail further. Here is the central problem of  the technological ‘Enframing’ and from which 
global warming became representative, if not a materialization, of modernity’s partly 
deficient precepts.  
The binary separation between ‘object’ and ‘s ubject’ is a highly debated problem that can 
only be underlined here as a characteristic of  Western modernity at large, and that is best 
epitomized by the eighteenth century/ea rly-modern philosopher Immanuel Kant’s 
‘Copernican turn’. In the Critique of Pure Reason , Kant attempted to unravel the 
epistemological dispute on the origin of knowle dge as being either empirical or cognitive, 
by asserting that, even if most knowledge un questionably has empirical roots, the mind 
remains the focal point and the condition sine qua non  for knowledge to even exist – and thus 
becomes the necessary condition for metaphysics itself to exist. This is what Kant calls the 
‘Copernican turn’. For Latour, this separation – of which th e ‘Copernican turn’ is not the 
starting point but the most representative mome nt – is what allowed Westerners to think of 
themselves as inherently different from ‘the ot hers’, the pre-moderns, as they thought this 
divide absolutely new. 
It is within this new separation that the se cond movement, the one best representing the 
modern relation to nature, came into action more evidently: this relation to nature was 
thought in terms of domination , and this is what is of prime im portance in our context. As the 
German philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer emphasized in Dialectic of 
Enlightenment , the ideals of the Enlightenment in Eu rope hoped to free human beings from 
fear of the unknown thanks to science, and a llow them to control nature and its resources 
yet, not in a new way, but within a religious  inheritance from which human supremacy was 
never questioned. As the authors pointed out,  the Jewish and Olympian religion (to which 
we can add the Christian religion), called fo r domination. The two authors directly quoted 
the book of Genesis , a referential text in the Jewish an d Christian religion as stating: “(…)  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 147 
and let them have dominion over fish of the se a, and over the fowl of the air, and over the 
cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth up the earth.”[19] 
For the authors, not only had the relation to nature barely changed, since the animals that 
were sacrificed in the past in place of Go d are still suffering th e “tournament of the 
laboratory,” with a couple of slight difference s that the authors specif ied [20], but this also 
paved the way for dictatorship in Europe: th e emergence of the subj ect and individuality 
better permitted, according to the author, the moulding and conformism into the mass. For 
the authors, this inheritance favoured the a ttempt at domination of man over nature, as 
much as of man over man. This is what is crucial to apprehend even in today’s world and 
also what supplements Heidegger’s argument. 
Not only this, but the philosophical duo, Ad orno and Horkheimer, even furthered their 
argument as far as to univocally qualify this do minative relation to nature and to humans as 
being “patriarchal.”[21] Adorno and Horkheimer ’s critic relates to, and even goes beyond, 
the ways in which Robert Hunter described in Thermageddon the passion of his childhood for 
cars and motorcycles, when he recalled pinning posters of cars on bedroom walls and 
admiring the tailfins of Ca dillacs, claiming that “ this was manhood.”[22] It is not exactly this 
masculine world that is at stake here, but so mething more deeply rooted than a mere 
addiction and dependence for car bodywork and rides. The problem is not one of gender, 
but of domination. For Adorno and Horkheimer, th is ‘patriarchal’ relation to nature is in 
operation within these particular instances: when the mind serves for ruling and knowledge is 
used as a power . For them, this failure is the failure of the Enlightenment, when the ideals 
such as those of the early-modern philosopher  and scientist Francis Bacon, who envisioned 
“the happy match between the mind of man and the nature of things,” ultimately failed 
since, as the two authors forcefully stated: “Wha t human beings seek to learn from nature is 
how to use it to dominate it and human beings ” (the italics are mine).[23] Which in turn 
explains the authors’ emphas is on the most paradoxical condition of the European 
Enlightenment: that it aimed at human’s betterment, but saw the most radical and 
devastating dictatorships. Some of the Wester n precepts of modernity therefore urgently 
need re-assessment as Latour already pointed out. 
In terms of war, even today, we have to admi t that a couple of Western countries are still 
entangled in devastating wars, which have b een displaced mainly to the Middle East. 
Hunter also underlined this aspect, when he stated that, beyond ecocides, there is an 
immediacy to look at this oil addiction politically. As he stated: “In purely political terms, oil 
has unleashed massacres, fortified criminal rulers, spawned atrocities, and served terrorism 
just about everywhere you look.”[24] To which it can be added that energy firms, that are 
other than oil-orientated, are no less stained or necessarily greener. For example, the French 
nuclear corporation AREVA has long been criticized for the little regard it gives to 
radioactive contamination of the mines, landscape and area it exploits, particularly in the 
former French colony of Niger, as much as (and most importantly), for the actual workers 
on site.[25] Whereas paradoxically, the nucl ear corporation AREVA intends to make a 
business out of the current crisis caused by global warming by advertising its services as 
‘C02-free’, while still using fossil fuel powere d boats to transport the processed uranium

from the mines to the French continent. This  s h o w s  a g a i n  t h e  e x p l o i t a t i o n  o f  n a t u r e  a n d  
humans by humans in such a concentrated fo rm, and most importantly in a neo-colonial 
form, and it underscores again the repetitive problem of dominion (beyond the wars started 
for oil) which undoubtedly presses for a re-assessment of Western modernity. In the face of 
such a lack of ethics, in the case of AREV A’s use of techno-scientific applications or 
corporate use at large, and as we already stated  throughout this chapter, it becomes obvious 
that the cause of the current crisis is not merely technological, it is also human and cultural, 
and this aspect needs to be consid ered in the finding of a solution. 
It must be said, however, that initially, the Western ideals of modernity had a reasonable 
justification – reasonable in the sense that it  a i m e d  a t  i n v o l v i n g  r e a s o n  a n d  r a t i o n a l i t y  i n  
decision making. At the origin of this modern  r e l a t i o n  t o  n a t u r e ,  t h e  s e p a r a t i o n  b e t w e e n  
‘object’ and ‘subject’ lies, paradoxically, the particularly modern ambition for secularity. 
Indeed, one of the precepts of the Enlightenment, as it developed in Europe, was to prevent 
beliefs and superstition interfering in a gi ven society’s doings. Natural phenomena were 
thought to be interpreted differently, that is, empirically and assumed to be observed 
‘objectively’ and, therefore, no longer as si gns from God – which ultimately is of upmost 
importance. For Latour, the appearance of the sci entific apparatuses, in the desire to observe 
natural phenomenon objectively, are in fact  p r e c e d i n g  K a n t ’ s  ‘ C o p e r n i c a n  t u r n ’  i n  t h e  
separation between the ‘object’ and the ‘subje ct’. Nature and culture, object and subject 
therefore become separated and human beings  c o n s i d e r e d  a s  s e p a r a t e d  f r o m  n a t u r e  –  
another typical Western turn. Nature is endowe d with a history and properties of its own 
and this, in order to prevent the use of natu ral phenomenon for political, ideological and 
religious agendas. However, as the two phil osophers Adorno and Horkheimer argued and 
as we have already underscored, the mythological, magical and religious original 
interpretation of the world persists, even in  o u r  m o d e r n  t i m e s ,  p r e c i s e l y  t h r o u g h  t h i s  
dominative behaviour. Here is another seminal clue to some of the imminent issues we still 
have to face today.  
Similarly to Adorno and Horkheimer, Latour also stated that this endless quest for 
domination found its limit. As he stated: “The repressed returns, and with a vengeance: the 
multitudes that were supposed to be saved from death fall back into poverty by the 
hundreds of millions; nature, over which we were supposed to gain absolute mastery, 
dominates us in an equally global fashion, and th reatens us all. It is a strange dialectic that 
turns the slave into man’s owner and master, and that suddenly informs us that we have 
invented ecocides as well as large-scale famine.”[26] For Latour, capitalism is also to blame, 
and communism did not achieve better since, by wanting to prevent the exploitation of men 
by men, it emphasized it instead. The nuclea r corporation AREVA is here again an example 
of what Latour underscored, as it certainly is the capitalist rules that pushed and still pushes 
forward this firm to try to sustain, at all costs,  its position of leader in the restricted market 
of nuclear reactors. Competition is not, howeve r, the main problem. In this example, the 
questions that in fact remain to be posed are the following: can sensitive technology, such as 
nuclear technology, be used and treated in th e same way as any other marketable product? 
In addition, can competition afford to disregard ethical consideration of nature and humans?  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 149 
Not only this, but since we un derscored the separation between ‘object’ and ‘subject’, we 
must acknowledge this modern attempt at secularity as failed once again– for even in the 
twenty-first century, one still th inks in terms of ‘belief’: on  t h e  o n e  h a n d ,  t h e  s e p a r a t i o n  
between the so-called ‘climate-sceptics’ and ‘alarmis ts’ forces one to claim if they ‘believe’ in 
climate change or not; while on the other hand , religious groups for instance, still question 
scientific empirical evidences such as Darwin’s  t h e o r y  o f  e v o l u t i o n  f o r  i n s t a n c e .  T o  c o m e  
back to the climate-sceptics, this phenomenon  m u s t  b e  a n a l y s e d  m o r e  c a r e f u l l y  h e r e ,  n o t  
simply for the rhetorical condition that we  p r e v i o u s l y  e x a m i n e d ,  t h e  o n e  l a b e l l i n g  a n d  
differentiating the two categories, but also and primarily for what can be called a ‘reversed 
religious justification’. It was precisely to prev ent the justification of an act, a murder or a 
war in the name of God that the Western earl y-moderns moved toward secularity, in a joint 
effort that encompassed many social activities  such as science, philosophy and art.[27] Yet 
this religious justification is reversed when the climate-sceptics use precisely the fact itself of 
being ‘sceptics’ and of not ‘believing’ in climat e change as a justification for their economic 
interests (some scientists being referenced as having worked for Exxon) – interests that in 
some cases led to still current wars in the Middle East. The previous use of religious 
justification to cover economical and ideological stakes, is here re-enacted through corporate 
interests. Modernity’s ideals of secula rity clearly failed in this instance.  
The present crisis, of which global warming is representative, is therefore wider than what 
we have tackled so far. It encompasses severa l cultural, political and economic stakes, about 
which we can do nothing but to underline them  in this context. A re-assessment of the 
Western project of modernity is therefore cr ucial. However, and as the international 
community has been moving towards a global solution to refrain the change in climate, we 
need to pay heed to this particular global  i n s t a n c e .  O n e  o f  t h e  r e a s o n s  f o r  t h i s  u r g e n c y  t o 
analyse this need for a universal solution is th at other ideals of the Western modernity need 
to be revised and it is important to consider them in our context.  
5. Universality I: Global warming in art and science 
Another of the characteristics of global warming is indeed that a universal  s o l u t i o n  i s  
required, or rather, that a universal effort to  reverse the current situ ation is demanded. In 
the humanities, universalism has long been critiqued, for it negates diversity and 
individuality. Yet in our context, the one of gl obal warming, this demand upon us to find a 
universal solution is flagrant and absolutely necessary on many levels, levels that are 
important to highlight since they add to th e list of characteristics of the Western 
development of modernity that need to be rethought. 
In the first instance, this universal effort requires scientists from a large number of 
disciplines to collect data and to find a soluti on. The scope of this n eed for interdisciplinary 
cooperation is extremely wide and exceeds the field of climatology and environmental 
sciences. For example, the fields of paleo- climatology, volcanology, marine biology, 
meteorology, space and computer science play an important role in monitoring as well as 
working towards finding a solution. This need fo r interdisciplinary cooperation is such that 
the prefix ‘climate’ is sometimes added to some already pre-existing scientific disciplines.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 150 
After dedicating much writing to demonstrate the extent to which the situation of climate 
change is nothing new, we must accentuate here  that the scope of this interdisciplinary need 
is what is perhaps the most specific characteri stic of the present situation, because the post-
modern interdisciplinary cooperation is extens ively required, more than it ever has been 
since the advent of modernity and even post-modernity.  
The urgency of our current state is such that a new scientific field was created, with its 
‘climate experts’, and this with no direct or major technological apparatus to define it. The 
international cooperation of scientists in this  matter dates from the nineteenth century, but 
never did it encompass such a wide range of disciplines, that have only recently been 
grouped under the name ‘climate science’.[28] As we already emphasiz ed, techno-scientific 
disciplines succeeded one another, creating new fields according to new resources or 
apparatuses, as biotechnology would, for exam ple, be characterized and defined by bio-
technological apparatuses and a focus on genetic material. In the modern era, we have seen 
a succession of nuclear technology, space technology, biotechnology and even 
nanotechnology. Yet climate change has created a field of experts that cuts across  the wide 
range of pre-existing disciplines. This is  p e r h a p s  t h e  m o s t  i m p o r t a n t  a n d  s p e c i f i c  
characteristic of climate change. The reason for this is simple: the effect of greenhouse gases 
affects the totality  of the planet and of our ecosystem, whereas the scientific research, as it 
has been conducted in the modern West so far, has been based predominantly on the 
specialisation and autonomy  o f  t h e  f i e l d s .  S p e c i a l i z a t i o n  a n d autonomy are another of the 
precepts of modernity that we have previous ly emphasized, such as secularity and the 
separation between ‘object’ and ‘subject’ or ‘nature’ and ‘culture’. 
The specialization of the fields is a problem that Heidegger already spotted in is magnum 
opus Being and Time  – so prominent in the humanities – even though the main argument of 
his piece is not directly directed at solving techno-scientific problems. Yet for him, the 
ontical sciences, or the empirical ones, make the mistake of trying to understand natural 
phenomenon from the restrictiv eness of the delimitation of their own discipline. While at 
the same time, he also clearly stated the absolute  necessity of the specialization of the fields 
in another essay titled Science and Reflexion , when he stated that “specialization is also not 
merely an unavoidable evil. It is a necessa ry consequence, and indeed the positive 
consequence, of the coming to presence of mo dern science.”[29] The current paradox is now 
clearly evident and calls for interdisciplinar y cooperation as perhaps never before, while 
requiring at the same time an advanced speciali zation of the scientists in the direct tradition 
of modernity’s autonomy of the fields – which can sometimes become an obstacle as each 
discipline has its own specific language. 
Yet we must acknowledge that this tension is however not always an obstacle and can 
become a force. The necessity of interdisciplinary cooperation has become so important that 
even the arts are being included into the effort and here in another from than a mere cultural 
barometer of interest or anxiety towards scienc e that we previously analysed with Goethe’s 
Faust for instance. For the last couple of decade s, the two disciplines, art and science, have 
been deploring the ways in which they are separated and so distant from one another – 
another result of the modern predicates of au tonomy of the fields. Yet in this instance, one  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 151 
has to admit that the challenge that climate change represents today favours, if not forces, a 
proximity and cooperation. One of the reasons for this is that artists are no less Earth’s 
citizens than are scientists, activist and poli ticians, and their stat ements and actions are 
therefore as important to cover as those fr om scientists, philosophers and experts.  
At first glance one might think th ese artistic activities done in response to climate change are 
of peripheral importance. Some art protagonists themselves look at this type of art with a 
doubtfuleye, but disregarding the importance of  artistic strategies would be a mistake. The 
efficiency is more subtle than one may think, for they work at a social level. A perfect 
example of this, among the myriad of artworks pr oduced in relation to climate change that 
are equally as inventive as one another, is th e work of the collective HeHe (Helen Evans and 
Heiko Hansen). In 2008, they organized a city-w ide event in Helsinki, Finland, during which 
a green laser was flashed, over night, onto  t h e  c l o u d  p r o d u c e d  b y  t h e  c h i m n e y  o f  t h e  
Salmisaari power plant – a coal power plant. Th e laser was interactive in the sense that it 
would, in real-time, reduce or expand according to the consumption in electricity of the city. 
The piece was titled Nuage Vert  (Green Cloud, Fig. 2) – the collective having an interest for 
human-made clouds at large such as cigarette smoke. [30] In order to realize the project, a 
joint effort between the artists and some expe rts was necessary, which is paradigmatic again 
of the current need for an interdisciplinary a pproach that post-modernity had already called 
for. The artistic event was made possible thanks  to the teamwork of experts in various areas 
such as air quality monitoring, electrical engineering, laser technology and computer 
science.

Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 152 
The specificity of the project is however manifo ld: on the one hand, not only did the artists 
give visibility to at least one type of green house gas – a phenomenon that still remains an 
abstract idea for many since most power plan ts are usually remotely located and that the 
greenhouse gases are mainly invisible; while on the other hand, they also worked within the 
city itself, with an intensive mediation of the project on a local level. The artists asked the 
inhabitants to reduce their use of electrical a ppliances in order to change the length of the 
green cloud during the week of the event. He He not only displayed posters throughout the 
city, but they also toured prim ary schools to explain the project to children, knowing that they 
would, in return, ask their parents to participate in the project and, by way of consequences, 
that they would ‘educate’ their parents on their level of consumption – education being 
perhaps one of the most forceful technologies  used by the collective in this project. 
Another specificity of the project of importan ce here is the link that was finally re-
established between humans and their local and direct environment. We have already 
showed the modern dissociation between ‘obj ect’ and ‘subject’, the separation between 
‘nature’ and ‘culture’, and most importantly, the dissociation of  the relationship cause-effect. 
Yet with Nuage Vert , more than a direct relation to ‘nature’, a cause-effect relationship is re-
established through the inhabitants’ direct lin k with the remote production of greenhouse 
gases that were made visible – a link that has been ruptured generations ago and definitely 
needs to be re-established. The tension between the specialisation of th e fields and the cross-
disciplinary discussion is here clearly a strength..  
It is on a similar plane of action that the fasci nating artistic approach of the American artist 
and biologist Brandon Ballengée is also located. For decades Ballengée has been locally 
collecting deformed frogs, reptiles and amphibians in different parts of the world in order to 
determine the cause of their deformities. This is  the ‘Malamp Project’ that he initiated in the 
late 1990s, among other equally important projects  of the artist. [31] As with the collective 
HeHe, interdisciplinary work is of central importance. Ballengée collaborated with 
numerous other scientists, such as Professo r Stan Session, an amph ibian specialist at 
Hartwick College, in New York, yet he also opens up his field trips to the public, in what he 
calls his ‘eco-actions’. Here the link human beings and nature is re-built in a different 
fashion than the modern one, through the aw areness of one’s own local ecosystem (and 
therefore consistent with the modern idea ls of enlightenment through knowledge). 
Ballengée’s artworks take different forms, between the ‘eco-actions’ (Fig. 3) and the 
exhibition of physical artworks: the artist de veloped a process to preserve the specimens, 
that colours their bones and cartilages, therefor e highlighting the deformities (Fig. 4). In the 
gallery space, large prints of the scanned sp ecimens, as well as th e preserved specimens 
themselves, are exhibited, ther efore constituting unavoidable empirical evidence of these 
birth defects.  
These birth defects have many causes, from pa rasites to predators and, unmistakably, from 
chemical pollution – a fact that has recently been under the spotlight of the media given the 
suddenly high numbers of eyeless prawns, fish  w ith le sio n s and crab s withou t claws  that 
have been fished up from the Gulf of Mexi co and for which the 2010 BP oil spillage is 
believed to be the cause on the 2010 BP oil spillage.[32] Ballengée’s strategy is therefore  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Modern  Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 153 
located at the tension between the modern idea ls and mistakes, as much as at the tension 
between the global and the local and a re -connected cause-effect relationship.

stained multi-limbed Pacific Treefrog, 2001/2007. 
It must be said that this type of art is not th e privileged strategy of individual artists on their 
own and sometimes encompass the cooperation of curators, museums and governmental or 
even independent founding bodies. The exhibition Lovely Weather  f o r  e x a m p l e  w a s  a n  
artists-in-residency project in Donegal, Ireland, that was co-c urated by Annick Bureaud and 
John Cunningham, with the help of Letterkenny  R e g i o n a l  C u l t u r a l  C e n t r e ,  t h e  P u b l i c  A r t  
Project of the Donegal County Council and the art/science journal Leonaro/Olats. [33] The 
primary aim of the exhibition however, and the sp ecificity of its strategy, was to have a local 
approach to the problem of global warming. On e of the artists in residence for instance, the 
Canadian artist Seema Goel, initiated a spinni ng and knitting worksh op whose final items, 
some socks and hats, used patterns from transl ated data coming from the Irish Malin Head 
meteorology station and other meteorological data (Fig. 5). Yet the workshop Has more 
ambition than simply materializing opaque data  for individuals. This project was initiated

after the artist came across a labelled ‘Donegal  s w e a t e r ’  t h a t  t h e r e f o r e  a p p e a r e d  t o  b e  
produced locally, but was in fact made in Thailand for the clothing corporation American 
Eagle. The intention of the project was primar ily to use sheep’s wool collected from local 
farms (which has almost no value for the farmer s) and to spin and kn it with it, therefore 
producing some typically and finally authentic Inishowen/Donegal wool. With this artwork, 
the problems of the exploitation of humans  b y  h u m a n s ,  o f  t h e  d i s a p p e a r a n c e  o f  l o c a l  
industries in the age of globalization and of the use of fossil fuel mean s of transportation in 
the exportation of products such as those produc ed by American Eagle, is here solved in one 
spin of a bobbin: the workshop started a wool  cooperative which is still active today.

To come back to the need for interdisciplinary work, it must be said that if this  
post-modern need for teamwork is of crucia l importance and a characteristic of the 
consequences of climate change, this interdisciplinary effort cannot, once again, be 
considered entirely new. In the past, and in the pre-modern West, art and science  
 
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 155 
were linked by the fact that they were direct ed towards cult and the scriptures. Religion 
was the unifying force. In Western art (or ‘craft’ since art was considered as such at that 
time), Renaissance painters or even the Greek sculptors and architects devoted their work 
for communication with the Gods and for the illu stration of religious or divine characters. 
The form and the content of the work of art was principally directed toward a cult  
and was an object of cult, as with the famous Renaissance frescoes and Greek temples.  
The same applied in ‘science’ – or in science as ‘knowledge’ –since science as a 
professional discipline only emerged in th e late 1830s. During the Middle Ages for 
example, Paul of Burgos, a prominent Spanis h religious character and exegete stated and 
published that the Earth had two centres of gravity, one for the soil and one for water.This 
was done in order to conform to the narrative of the creation of the universe by God, as 
described in the book of Genesis , when God immersed the Earth with water and ordered 
on the third day for dry land to appear.[34] The development of new techniques, craft, 
and the knowledge of the cosmos and political  decision where unified through religious 
beliefs.  
Trans-disciplinary cooperation is therefore not new and it is not the first time to be put to 
work since the advent of the modern autono my and specialization of the fields. Other 
examples, and closer to us, are the totalitaria n regimes, such as Nazism in Germany and 
Communism in Russia, that saw the enforcem ent of cooperation between art and science, 
as with other social activities, in the service of the regime. Yet their aims were ideological 
and their scope national. The rarity of the cu rrent situation is such that there is no 
political-ideological input, nor particular nation al stakes – or at least not at first glance. 
The scope is transnational and trans-disciplinar y (even though we have to note here that 
the bulk of what some call ‘climate art’ is mainly created by Western artists). However, 
climate change and the threat of it represents a call for a wider universal effort and, 
paradoxically, a demand for cooperation and simultaneously specialization, therefore 
putting modernity’s autonomy of the fields in to question. We previously showed how the 
origin of the current crisis is  not technological and we have now to acknowledge that the 
finding of a solution does not necessarily include technological devices. Not only this, but 
in the ontological approach we have conducted so far, human beings were considered as a 
whole, as if there was only one human category , one unconsciously thinking of its relation 
to nature in terms of domination. Yet are all humans the same? With the same 
background, history or culture? Do they all share the same role in the triggering the 
current crisis? Acknowledging this will help us to give perspective to the call for a 
universal solution for global warming and underline better the role played by the Western 
project of modernity in the present situation. 
6. Universalism II: International politics, from the competition of the 
empires to the Cancun agreement 
At another glance and after underlining the paradox between universalism (or the need for 
interdisciplinary work) and the specialization of the fields, climate change implies not only a  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 156 
joint scientific effort, but also a joint effort on behalf of all Earth’s citizens, no matter their 
origins, nationality or activities. This is what is utterly new in this situation, climate change 
is a global phenomenon that concerns each of us. Yet what we must clearly ask is the 
following question: is ultimate universalism even achievable? 
Once again, we can put forward the claim that ideally ‘we’, the citizens of the Earth, ‘we’ 
the scientists, the corporate energy agencies, the politicians of the world, the non-experts - 
in a word ‘we’ the human beings at large, can, should and will combine our forces and 
will work together. After all, that is precis ely what Albert Einstein hoped for when he 
called for unity in his Manifesto  a g a i n s t  w e a p o n s  o f  m a s s  d e s t r u c t i o n ,  w r i t t e n  w i t h  
Bertrand Russell in 1955. As they stated: “We appeal as human beings, to human beings: 
Remember your humanity, forget the rest.”[35]  For Einstein and Russell, no matter what 
the issue is, “whether Communist or anti-C ommunist, whether Asian or European or 
American, whether White or Black, then these issues must not be decided by war.”[36] We 
must be optimists and imagine that this plea will be met today, given the necessity of a 
transnational unification to solve the problem. Yet we must admit that, in the case of 
nuclear weapons, this universal solution was certainly not reached, even today. The 
recent wrestles between Western countries and Iran on Iran’s nuclear programme or the 
possible use of depleted uranium in the 1991 Iraqi war are evidence enough. In the case of 
nuclear weapons, a universal agreement still appears hardly achievable. Consequently, 
can a universal agreement be achieved in order to battle against the changes of climate of 
the Earth, given the imminence of the threat? 
The divides that prevent a unique solution ar e in fact numerous and can only be mapped 
out here in a restricted form, before looking at a couple of solutions. One of the main causes 
of dissension is of course economic, caused by the many competing national interests. The 
American refusal to sign th e Kyoto protocol, followed by  t h e  R u s s i a n  h e s i t a t i o n ,  i s  
paradigmatic of this difficulty in reaching a universal agreement (and  therefore a solution) 
because of national interest. The George W. Bush administration declared following the 
protocol that it would gravely endanger the US economy, while Russia had a similar claim 
before finding more support from the European Union.  
A second important cause, preventing univ ersal agreement, which we have already 
underscored, is the divide between the climate-sceptics and the others. The interests of the 
large industrial and energetic corporations – or the ‘Carbon Club’ as Hunter calls them – 
are still too important for them to feel co ncerned by ethics in any form. Preventing 
ecocides does not guarantee economic benefits – of this we already know the problem. Yet 
this divide does not concern the Carbon Club alone, nor even the divide among the 
scientists at large, but is spread among th e world population to the point that a very 
controversial publicity film was launched – then withdrawn – as part of a British and 
global campaign called 10:10. The campaign aimed at reducing carbon emission by ten 
percent in 2010, following the Copenhagen ac cords, and in order to give a sense of 
responsibility to individuals, companies and businesses globally.[37] Yet the four minute

showed signs of scepticism or are lackin g enthusiasm with regard to the 10:10 
campaign.[38] Although withdrawn from the ca mpaign even before broadcast, the video 
spread on the Internet and caused a public outcry. This particular instance is of 
importance, first because climate change is still contested even today and tends to fade 
away in public debates. As the organization stated, to explain their video: “With climate 
change becoming increasingly threatening, an d decreasingly talked about in the media, 
we wanted to find a way to bring this critical issue back into the headlines whilst making 
people laugh.”[39] Secondly, this aspect is of importance because it shows that it still 
takes a lot of marketing strategies, provocation, financing and imagination to sustain 
concern from the public with regard to the pr oblem. As Franny Armstrong, the founder of 
the 10:10 campaign stated: “We’ve ‘killed’ five people to make No Pressure  – a mere blip 
compared to the 300,000 real people who now die each year from climate change.”[40] 
Sensitizing individuals appears to be as diff icult as forcing energy corporations comply. 
Most of all, we have to realize that it takes time, since the first conferences on climate 
change in the 1980s, for the idea of the absolu te necessity of cultural change to make its 
way into people’s mind and for this idea to remain. 
Another peripheral yet still significant cause preventing general agreement that was quite 
apparent during the moments of the Kyoto pr otocol, and beautifully pictured by Hunter 
in Thermageddon , is based on political regimes and cultural differences. The most obvious 
example is again the George W. Bush administration’s justification for its reluctance in 
taking part to the global effort, that this reluctance had to do with the fact that it would 
affect the ‘American life style itself’ and its car-addiction habit. An other cultural tension 
also described by Hunter was the dismay ge nerated by a discussion between the members 
of an Arab and a Canadian delegation. According to Hunter, in order to reply to the 
statement of the Arab representatives, who argued for the importance of keeping low 
prices for petrol, so “the poor can drive to work,”[41] the Canadian delegate suggested a 
redistribution of wealth instead. Not only was the difference between the two 
understandings of the problem blatant, but th e Canadian delegate was a female and this 
caused her to be swiftly dismi ssed, as Hunter recalled, and to which he added “but what 
could they do in a foreign democracy where women have the vote?”[42] How can one 
find a general consensus in spite of the cultural, ideological, economic and political 
differences, which should be a force enriching the debate but which in this condition 
rather appears as an obstacle? Here again, as we already pointed out the finding of a 
solution does not involve purely technological concerns. 
Adding to this aspect is the divide betw een the East and the West, or between the 
developed and industrialized countries. Apprehending this divide is of prime importance, 
for it relates to the urgency of revising the Western project of modernity itself and also  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 158 
adds to the cultural histories that consciously or unconsciously precondition our relation 
to nature and human beings. This problem was again portrayed by Hunt er, for instance in 
the lecturing of an American representative to delegates of developing countries such as 
China, Brazil and India, on the effort the latt er countries would have to produce to reduce 
carbon emission – to which somebody in the au dience finally said in order to point out the 
paradox: “A nation of sports utility vehicl es lecturing nations of bicycles?”[43] This 
paradox is representative of a wider problem whose causes are, again, deeply rooted, 
politically and historically. The divide between the East and the West is a consequence of 
the Western project of modernity as this project was linked to the building of the 
European Empires. 
On the one hand, it would be absolutely un ethical to avoid mentioning here that the 
emission of greenhouse gases is an unpredicte d yet direct outcome of the modernization of 
the West through the two Industrial Revolution s, which was initiated in Europe and in the 
West at large. It is this problem that now affects the totality of the planet and countries – 
hence Bruno Latour’s instance on the impo rtance to revise Western modernity. In We Never 
Have Been Modern , Latour also alerted us to the import ance of considering this divide. He 
asserted that modernization was brutal toward the pre-moderns and that post-
modernization now represents another challenge. As he stated: “Imperialist violence at least 
offered a future, but sudden weakne ss on the part of the conquerors is far worse for, always 
cut off from the past, it now also breaks with  the future. Having been slapped in the face 
with modern reality, poor population s now have to submit to post-modern 
hyperreality.”[44] Because the Western techno- sciences are being exported, a revision of 
their use and applications is doubtlessly necessary. 
However, on the other hand, we must also consid er the fact that the idea of modernity itself 
was precisely constructed through this divide  b e t w e e n  t h e  E a s t  a n d  t h e  W e s t .  T h e  g r e a t  
Universal Exhibitions that were staged in the late nineteenth century constitute the best 
example. In these exhibitions, Western scientific devices and art objects were opposed to 
colonized cultures presented as backward and archaic. The 1889 exhibition, that was held in 
Paris, even gathered from the colonies some  i n h a b i t a n t s  a n d  t h e i r  h a b i t a t s ,  t h a t  w e r e  
exhibited in human zoos and contrasted to reconstituted medieval houses (Fig. 6). The 
narrative suggested via these juxtapositions was the superiority of the Empire, illustrated by 
the demonstration of technological superiority. Here is a particularly flagrant example of the 
patriarchal use or understanding of technolo gy and humans as critiqued by Adrono and 
Horkheimer. The narrative in turn was used espe cially by the French Empire to justify its 
imperialist wars that were nonetheless initiated in the midst of a competition of strength 
and power between the few Empires of Europe. 
This implemented fracture, between the East an d the West, is also accentuated by the fact 
that the industrialization of the developing countries is now asked to be curbed because of 
the problem of gas emission – a crisis which originated in Western and illustrates again the 
importance to consider parameters that are no  technological in the finding of a resolution.  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Modern  Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 159 
Moreover, in this necessary attempt at finding a common consensus, how can international 
organizations, such as the United Nations an d UNESCO succeed? By trying to universalize 
a method of calculation of anthropogenic emissi ons, by quantifying li mitations or reduction 
commitment according to countries as the Kyoto Pr otocol tried to do, in  such an attempt at 
finding a common equation to filter all discrepa ncies and level them down to equality in the 
task of reducing greenhouse gas emission, ho w can one rationalize and put into numbers 
the richness and variety of paths that each country follows (whose borders are not always 
stable) as much as the differences in  power that still divide the world?

Paris, 1891-1892. 
Universalism and diversity are here again clea rly at stake and a recurrent tension. The 
problem of climate change is therefore taken here into another context, beyond the 
techno-scientific or even philosophical problem. The greatest challenge for today’s world 
is therefore located in this particular divide, when the intricate geopolit ical interests that were 
at play in the advent of modernity in the West are still at stake today . The example of the 
exploitation in a uranium mine by the French company AREVA already described, the 
lack of ethics in the exploitation of mines and workers of the former colony of Niger, 
clearly shows the extent to which a more profou nd change in human ac tivities at large is 
needed.  
In the midst of these difficulties, we must however consider the late appearance on the 
horizon of international and socio-political breakthroughs. The Barack Obama 
administration, for instance, re-oriented the US policy towards more contribution with the 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 
 160 
Copenhagen Accord of 2009, then with the Cancun Agreement (reached at a United 
Nations conference on climate change in Mexico in 2010) . An international fund, called 
Green Climate Fund, has even been establis hed. This fund would help developing 
countries financially for climate-oriented programmes, projects and policies, which 
constitutes a fantastic step forward even though its financing is not yet defined. However, 
no matter how great these political decisions ar e, they are also dependent on the integrity, 
good will and the seriousness of the politica l leaders as individual s, and are therefore 
bound to them – showing here again that the solution to the problem is not merely 
technological. 
7. Conclusion 
As we just argued, even if we develop a re volutionary technological device, the current 
crisis might well be fixed, but will this al so prevent the misuse of technology? In other 
words: will the technological apocalypse be permanently stopped or simply delayed? At 
present, they are some solutions in sight, al ong with international cooperation. Yet if the 
search for sustainable sources of energy is developing, how sustainable are the efforts on 
a socio-political and economic level given that the world is still affected by international 
conflicts and exploitation  of humans by humans? Furtherm ore, within the continuous 
effort that is incontestably and unconditiona lly needed on the part of the scientific 
research, how will the numerous future te chnological innovations adequately serve 
humans with respect to the diversity of their place of birth, history and culture and this, 
beyond the Eastern/Western divide? In order to face the persistent misuse of scientific 
applications that started to be dramatically recurrent since the 19th c e n t u r y ,  t h e  
parameters to consider in addition to the techno-scientific ones are therefore numerous. 
Without revising the interaction of humans towards their environment, without realising 
that humans are ‘the one spoken too’, as Heidegger stated, and not the ones controlling 
nature, can the centuries-long technological misuse (or ‘Enframing’ to use Heidegger’s 
vocabulary) be stopped? Without a re-adjustment of the patriarchal  understanding of the 
world – and most importantly: of humans – that Adorno and Horkheimer underlined, and 
the inheritance of the religious call for domination over nature, will we solve the 
problem? In the search for a solution , the separation between developed and 
industrialised countries, the impact of coloni zation and of post-modernity, the impact of 
the lobbyists and of the patriarchal/dominative behaviour in any place of the world must 
be addressed. 
To be more precise, within these ideal ye t necessary revisions, of the interaction  
of humans with their environment an d with humans, it in fact is the modern  split between 
nature and culture, as much as the modern secularity, that are at stake. As we  
already pointed out, it indeed is the western project of modernity at large that needs to be 
revised as Bruno Latour alread y argued in the 1990s. In We Never Have Been Modern , 
Latour urged for a revision of some of the predicates of modernity, in particular the  
The Issue of Global Warming Due to the Mod ern Misuse of Techno-Scientific Applications 
 161 
separation between ‘object’ and ‘subject’. Not on ly this, but for him, it is the modern idea 
of progress itself that needs to be reconsidered, since the modern mistakes, accidents and 
disasters should equally be considered instead of an idea of technological and social 
betterment, where the future is envisioned as necessarily better than the present. Is it not 
indeed this precise mythical understanding of modernity that has led an entire generation 
to leave a legacy of pollution of thousands-year radioactive waste in the hope that a 
solution will be found by the future ge nerations, then imagined to be ultra-
techonologised? To paraphrase the notorious nineteenth century French poet Charles 
Baudelaire: if no one cannot dispute the fact that our lives are better today than they 
would have been a hundred years ago, how can one bet on their betterment in the future? 
A century later, the same question still imposes itself, which finally urges to ask: will we 
learn from our mistakes?

1. Introduction 
Concerns about climate change have prompted ca lls for action at every level of government 
and across many sectors of economy and society. It is therefore pertinent to establish a suite of 
coordinated activities that will examine the seriou s and sweeping issues associated with global 
climate change, including the science and tech nological challenges involved, and provide 
advice on actions and strategies nations can take to respond to it [1]. Therefore, a proper and 
good understanding of what climate is and di sruptions that variation in climate (climate 
change) may cause, as we consider its impact on  social and economic stability is of paramount 
importance. Global warming is no longer a specul ation. The threat is real and has far reaching 
consequences. It is absolutely necessary therefor e, to sensitize peoples of all nations about the 
imminent danger posed by global warming and depletion of fresh water resources.  
According to [2], water scarcity has emerged as a global issue in recent times and South 
Africa, currently categorized as water stressed country is forecasted to experience physical 
water scarcity by the year 2025 with an annual  freshwater availability of less than 1000 m3 
per capita. The main cause of the scarcit y is growing extensive water demand and 
availability of limited water resources. The situation is further being aggravated by 
population growth, economic development, urbanization and in more recent times by 
anthropogenic climate change ([3]; [4]). 
Global climate change is a sensitive subjec t which affects the environment, ecology and 
quality of life on the earth. Global variations  in climate have brough t about extreme events 
like flood and drought which have had dras tic impacts on river basin development 
structures. Such structures include dams on which nations in Africa have depended for 
most of its renewable energy generation [5].   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 166 
[6] defined global warming as an average increa se in the earth's temperature which in turn 
causes changes in climate and reported that global warming enhances the water cycle by 
intensifying the cycle of water. It is speculated that as a result of global warming, more 
cloud will form and there will be more rain and snow especially in areas close to water 
whereas in areas particularly away from wa ter sources, excessive evaporation would dry 
out soil and vegetation, resulting in fewer clouds  and less precipitation. Thus, the area will 
probably get more droughts, rivers and lake s will become shallower and the amount of 
groundwater decreases. 
Global warming or climate variab ility is expected to alter the timing and magnitude in runoff 
and soil moisture. As a result, it has importan t implications for the existing hydrological 
balance and water resources as well as for future water resources planning and management. 
Quantitative estimation of the hydrological effects of climate change is therefore essential for 
understanding and solving potential water resour ce problems that may occur in the future 
([7]; [8]). In the past, decisions relating to the management of extreme climatic conditions, 
especially as they affect developments within river basins, have either been experimental or 
experiential [9]. Such subjecti ve approaches have not been able to provide quantitative 
measure for predicting future climate change im pact. This study aimed at using statistical and 
mathematical modelling approach to provide quantitative measures of past, present and 
future climate change impacts in the Vanderkloof  river basin, South Africa. It focused on the 
specific impact of global warming as related to  the operation of the Vanderkloof dam in South 
Africa. The specific objectives of  this study include studying th e impact of global warming on 
the Vanderkloof River catchments in order to dete rmine its effect on the hydrology of the basin 
especially on the municipal water supply, hydrop ower and irrigation systems in the basin and 
suggesting ways of maintainin g and improving on the existing  o u t p u t s  f r o m  t h e  e x i s t i n g  
system in spite of the clim ate change phenomenon. The ou tcome of the study will help 
determine the impact of climate change on the Va nderkloof River basin. It will also be useful 
in suggesting water management options an d preparing operationa l guides for the dam 
system so as to optimize the use of availabl e water resources. This will help in making 
recommendations to policy makers and the auth orities of the dam system to enhance the 
future operation of the dam. 
2. Methodology 
2.1. Data and statistics 
Long term time series data of 14 Hydro-meteor ological variables of the Vandekloof watershed 
was analysed using mathematical and statistical methods with the aim of developing 
quantitative models that can be used to foreca st future climate change  scenarios in the basin 
and evaluate the performance of the dam system. The variables used include the average 
annual values of minimum temperature, maxi mum temperature, averag e temperature, wind 
speed, watershed precipitation, dam surface prec ipitation, dam surface evaporation, reservoir 
inflow, reservoir outflow, reservoir elevation, reservoir storage, turbine release, irrigation 
water release and municipal water supply. Range of minimum temperature, maximum 
temperature, average temperature, wind speed and watershed precipitation spans from 1977 Impact of Regional Climate Change on Freshwater  
Resources and Operation of the Vand erkloof Dam System in South Africa 167 
to 2011 (35 years), dam surface precipitation, dam surface evaporation, reservoir inflow, 
reservoir outflow, reservoir elevation, reservoir storage and turbine release ranged from 1977 
to 2008 (32 years), while the span of data for irrigation water release and municipal water 
supply is from 1990 to 2008 (19 years). Sample statistics such as mean, standard deviation, 
variance, skewness coefficient and kurtosis were  c o m p u t e d  t o  p r o v i d e  a n  i n s i g h t  i n t o  t h e  
characteristic (e.g cent re and dispersion) of th e respective population parameters. Normality of 
the data was examined using skewness coefficient and kurtosis.  
2.2. Estimation of autocorrelation coefficient and pre-whitening of data series 
Autocorrelation or serial correlation may cause an increase in the expected number of false-
positive trends. If autocorrelation  exists in the time-series data , an approach to remove this 
trend needs to be adopted. The approach used to detect lag k autocorrelation is based on the 
equation ([10]; [11]): 
 ݎ௞ൌσσሺ௫೟ି௫ҧሻሺ௫೟శೖି௫ҧሻಿషೖ
೟సభ
σሺ௫೟ି௫ҧሻమ ಿ
೟సభேି௞
௧ୀଵ  ( 1 )  
where xt is the time-series data value at time t and N is the number of samples for constant 
sampling interval. The range of rk is 0 ǂ rk ǂ 1 with a value of 0 meaning that the time-series 
is independent, and a value of 1 meaning that autocorrelation exists [10]. Autocorrelation is 
tested for at the 95% significance level. The first-order autocorrelation coefficient r1 i s  
especially important because for physical systems, dependence on past values is likely to be 
the strongest for the most recent past. For the one-sided test, the World Meteorological 
Organization recommends that the 95% significance level for rk be computed by [11]: 
 11 6 4 5 195.(% )kNkrNk   ( 2 )  
where N is the sample size and k is the lag. If the computed value of autocorrelation is 
greater than the critical value at a signif icance level of 95%, then the existence of 
autocorrelation in the time series data is not by chance and a method for removing this may 
be adopted. The most common approach for remo ving the impact of serial correlation in 
time-series data is the pre-whitening method as follows [10]: 
 1–tt k txp x r x    (3) 
where xpt is the pre-whitened series for time interval t, xt is the original variable x for time 
interval t, and rk is the estimated serial correlation co efficient at lag k. In this study, 
equations 1 to 3 were adopted to detect the pres ences of serial correlation in the time series 
of the hydro-meteorological variable.  
2.3. Statistical trend analysis 
Trend analysis is a statistical method widely  implemented to analyz e hydrological time 
series of temperature, streamflow, precipitatio n and other climatic variables [10]; [12]; [8]; 
[13]. The statistical trend analys is in this study was carried out in three phases. First the

nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was applie d to detect the presence of monotonic 
increasing or decreasing tren d in the time series of the hydro-meteorological random 
variables. Second, the slope of a linear trend in the data series was estimated using two 
methods of linear regression analysis. Last, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation 
Coefficient of the variables and time were comp uted to determine the strength of the linear 
relationship between the variables and time. 
2.3.1. Trend detection 
The time series of some hydrological random variables often exhibit significant trends over 
time. Trend detection in hydro-meteorological time series is of practical importance in 
analyzing the impacts of global warming and climate change in the various ecosystems of 
the earth. Statistical procedures may be adopte d for the detection of the gradual trends in 
hydrological series over time. The purpose of tr end testing is to determine if the values of a 
random variable is generally increasing (or decreasing) over some period of time in 
statistical terms [14]. The Mann-Kendall test is a non-parametric test which is commonly 
adopted to detect monotonic trends in hydrolog ic data analysis. This test does not require 
the assumption of normality of the random vari able and only indicates the direction but not 
the magnitude of significant trends. Trends de tectable by the Mann-Kendall method are not 
necessarily linear. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall test is less affected by the presence of 
outliers because its test statistic S, is based on the sign of differences and not directly on the 
values of the random variable. Due to its advantages, this test has been applied in a series of 
recent climate studies ([15]; [16]; [ 13]; [10]; [12]). The null hypothesis Ho in the Mann-Kendall 
test is that there is no trend and data are in dependent and randomly ordered. This is tested 
against an alternative hypothesis H1, that there exists a trend in the time series. The Mann-
Kendall test statistic S is estimated using the equation ([12]; [14]):

A high positive value of the S statistic indicates an increasing trend, while a low negative 
value indicates a decreasing tren d in the time series of the random variable. The evaluation 
of the probability associated with S a n d  t h e  s a m p l e  s i z e ,  n, is however necessary to 
determine the statistical significance of the trend [17]. The variance of S is computed as

where q is the number of tied groups and tp is the number of data values in the pth group. For 
a sample size of n > 10, the sampling distribution of S is known to follow a standard normal 
distribution Z. The computed values of S and VAR(S) are used to compute a Z test statistic 
as follows [14]:

significance. The critical values of Z at 95% and 99% significance levels are Z0.025=1.96 and 
Z0.001=2.58  respectively . The trend is said to be decreasing if Z is negative and the absolute 
value of Z, computed using equation (7), is greate r than the critical value, while it is 
increasing if Z is positive and greater than the crit ical value. If the absolute value of Z is less 
than the critical value, there is  no trend and the alternative hypo thesis that there is a trend is 
rejected [17]. The significance of a trend simp ly implies that the occurrence of the trend is 
not by a process of chance in the selection of the random sample, it has a definite cause. If a 
trend is significant at the 99% level of significance , then it is said to be highly significant [18]. 
2.3.2. Development of regression models 
Regression analysis involves the use of mathem atical and statistical te chniques for modeling 
and analyzing several variables with the aim of developing quantitative relationships 
between a dependent variable and one or mo re independent variables. Specifically, 
regression analysis provides insight into ho w the typical value of a dependent variable 
changes when one of the independ ent variables is varied while the others are held constant. 
Regression analysis is widely used for predic tion and forecasting. This study employs the 
use of two methods of linear regression to develop quantitative statistical models for climate 
change analysis in the Vanderkloof River Basin, South Africa. The first method is a 
parametric method while the second is a nonparametric method of linear regression 
analysis. The parametric method employs the me thod of least-squares deviations while the 
non-parametric method involved the use of th e Thiel-Sen estimator of slope to develop the 
respective linear model equations. Parametric methods are suitable wh en the population can 
be assumed to conform to a particular probability distribution, whereas non-parametric 
methods are distribution free methods. Non- parametric methods are often used due to 
theirs advantages: simplicity, capability of handling non-normal and missing data 
distributions, and robustness to the effects of outliers and gross data errors ([10]; [19]. 
2.3.2.1. Method of least squares 
The least-square method of linear regression  r e q u i r e s  t h e  a s s u m p t i o n s  o f  n o r m a l i t y  o f  
residuals, constant variance, and true linearity  of relationship [12]. Norm ality implies that  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 170 
the population from which the sample was drawn is normally distributed. Many statistical 
procedures rely on population normality. The nu ll hypothesis for a normality test states that 
the population is normal. The alternative hypo thesis states that the population is not 
normal. The regression equation is obtained as [20]:

2.3.2.2. Thiel-Sen method of linear regression 
The Sen’s slope estimator also known as th e Kendall robust line-fit method is a non-
parametric method of robust linear regression that chooses the median  slope among all lines 
through pairs of two-dimensional sample points . This method offers many advantages and 
competes well against simple least squares even for normally distributed data. It can be 
computed efficiently and is insensitive to the presence of outliers; it can be significantly 
more accurate than simple linear regression for skewed and heteroskedastic data. Missing 
values are allowed and the data need not conf orm to any particular distribution. Moreover, 
the Sen’s method is not greatly affected by single data errors ([21]; [19].  
The Sen’s method can be used in analysis wher e the trend can be assumed to be linear i.e. 
 ()tft Q B  ( 1 1 )  
where Q is the slope, B is a constant called the intercept and t is time. To evaluate the slope 
estimate Q in equation (11) the slopes of all data va lue pairs is computed using the equation  
 jk
ixx
Qjk
  ( 1 2 )  
where j>k . If there are n values xj in the time series there will be as many as N = n(n-1)/2 
slope estimates Qi. The Sen’s estimator of slope is the median of these N values of Qi. To 
obtain an estimate of B in equation (11) the n values of differences xi – Qt i are calculated. The 
median of these values gives an es timate of the intercept, B [21].  
2.4. Computation of correlation coefficients 
Correlation coefficient measures the strength of the linear relationship between a dependent 
and an independent variable ([18]; [22]). In using the Pearson Product Moment Correlation 
Coefficient, The sample correlation ( r), is obtained using equation (13), [20]: Impact of Regional Climate Change on Freshwater  
Resources and Operation of the Vand erkloof Dam System in South Africa 171

ݎ ranges from -1 to 1. A value of r close to 0 indicates that there is no association between the 
variables. R-square ( ܴଶ), or the square of the correlation co efficient, is a fr action between 0.0 
and 1.0. A ܴଶ v a l u e  o f  0  m e a n s  t h a t  t h e r e  i s  n o  c o rrelation between the variables and no 
linear relationship exist between them. On the other hand, when ܴଶ a p p r o a c h e s  1 . 0 ,  t h e  
correlation becomes strong and with a value of 1.0, all points lie on a straight line ([18]; [20]). 
In this study, the Microsoft Excel software was used for the computation of relevant 
statistics and plotting of figures. A program was also written in visual basic for applications 
to facilitate the computation of the Man-Kendall statistics S, Sen’s slope Q, and intercept B.

The Mankendall analysis detected an insignif icant positive trend in minimum tempratures 
over the 35 year period of available data (F igure 1). A Man-Kendall Statistic S = 55 and Sen 
slope estimate Q = 0.0085 indicate a positive trend in the timeseries. On the contrary, a 
regression slope coefficient a = -0.004 indicate a negative trend. [23] has noted that the time-
series of hydro-meteorological random vari able often exhibit a remarked skew and are 
usually not normally distributed. Hence in this study, the results of the non-parametric 
Mankendall test and Sen slope estimate are accept ed. Therefore, we conclude that there is a 
positive trend in the time series of mini mum temperature, though the trend is not 
significant. 
For the analysis of the average temperature (F igure 2), a Man-Kendall Statistic S = 67, Sen 
slope estimate Q = 0.0064, and the regression slop e coefficient a = 0.006 all indicate a positive 
trend. A correlation coefficient a = 0.164 show s a weak relationship, and the Z value of 
1.0292 shows that the trend is not significant.  
The analysis of the time-series of maximum temperature however, shows beyond 
reseaonable doubt that there is evidence of  g l o b a l  w a r m i n g  i n  t h e  r e g i o n .  T h e  m a x i m u m  
temperature trend is significant at the 95% an d 99% levels of significance (Table 4), thus 
indicating a highly significant rise in maximum temperatures (Figure 3). A Man-Kendall 
Statistic S = 334, Sen slope estimate Q = 0.06, and the regression slope coefficient a = 0.078 
indicate a positive trend. A correlation coeffi cient a = 0.79 also shows a strong relationship 
and a Z value of 5.172 shows that th e trend is highly significant.  
It was found that wind speed has generally be ing in a uptrend. A Man-Kendall Statistic S = 
113 and positive values of Sen slope estimates and regression coefficient accompanied by a 
Z value of 1.738 also showed that relative wi ndspeed has being in an insignificant uptrend 
(Figure 4).  
In order to obtain an estimate of global warm ing on precipitaion in the river watershed, the 
rainfall time series data of a nearby town was analysed. The analysis sh owed that rainfall in 
areas futher away from the wate r bodies has been in a down (though not significant) trend 
(Figure 5). Analysis of the inflow into the reservoir (Figure 6) also shows a downward 
insignificant trend. Thus less precipitation on the water shed has invariably resulted in less 
inflow from the surrounding ar eas. On the contrary, it wa s found that rainfall in the 
immediate vicinity of the dam, especially on the dam surface has been in an uptrend (Figure 
7). Though the trends are not si gnificant, a study of the trends however is in concordance 
with the speculation of [6] that areas away from water sources are likely to get less 
precipitation and dry out, while areas closer to water bodies will get more rainfall thus 
resulting in a localized climate phenomenom. Da m surface evaporation has also been in an 
unsignificant downtrend (Figure 8). 
Analysis of reservoir elevation (Figure 9) and resrvoir storage (Figure 10) with a Z statistics 
of 0.8185 and 0.8838 respectively, shows that this va riables have also been in an insignificant 
uptrend. The insignificant uptr end in the outflow from the reservoir (Figure 11), suggests 
that though there has been a slig ht drop in inflow to the reservoir due to the dry conditions 
of the surrounding lands, this has been more than compensated for by  the increase in the 
dam surface precipitation and drop in reservoir evaporation.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 182 
The high increase in irrigation water supply  f r o m  t h e  r e s e r v o i r s  i s  a m o n g  m a n y  o t h e r  
factors partly due to the impact of climate change in the surrounding area. Drying-out 
farmlands in the surrounding areas requires mo re irrigation water from the reservoir. A 
Man-Kendall Statistic S = 111, Sen slope estimate Q = 831.76 and a regression slope 
coefficient a = 1155 all indicate a strong positi ve trend. A correlation coefficient a = 0.687 
shows a strong relationship and a Z value of 3. 84 shows that the trend is significant at the 
95% and 99% critical levels (Table 4). Likewi se, municipal water supply to surrounding 
towns has been in a highly sign ificant trend (Figure 13). Figure 14 shows that there has been 
a slight drop in the water supplied to the power industry. 
4. Conclusion 
Developing quantitative functional relation ship between hydro-meteorological random 
variables and time helps provide insight into how the variables trends and provide a means 
of extrapolation for future climate scenarios. Quantifying the extent to which precipitation 
and streamflow changes are due to changes in regional climat e is an important problem in 
hydrology. Specifically, in this study, an attempt was made to develop models that relate 
climatic variables to time and provide a mean s of estimating future  c l i m a t e  c h a n g e  i n  
quatitative terms for the Vanderkloof River basin in South Africa. 
From the results of the analyses , temperatures in the vicinity of the dam have been in a 
significant uptrend over the years. Thus it ma y be concluded that there is enough evidence 
of global warming in the region. Global warming has produced favourable climate 
conditions around Vanderkloof da m as evident from the slight uptrend in the rainfall on the 
dam surface. The non-significant decrease in inflow to the dam has been balanced by the 
increased precipitation on the reservoir surface.  The significant uptrend in irrigation water 
supply to surrounding farmlands due to dryer conditions and the significant increase in 
municipal water supply have resulted in a slight decrease in water supply to the power 
industry, though not significan t. The slight uptrend in th e outflow from the reservoir 
suggests that water supply for various uses is still sustainable under the prevailing climate 
condition if properly allocated. Recommendation is hereby made to the operators of the 
dam to optimize the release of water from the dam so as to ensure optimal operation of the 
dam and sustain power generation, irrigation and allocation for other uses so as to 
maximize the net benefit obtainable from the reservoir under the prevailing climate 
condition.

1. Introduction 
There is a consensus about the or igin of the increase of glob al surface temperature of the 
20th century is the fast process of industria lization, that is producing an exponential 
increase in CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the boundary layer of the Earth atmosphere. 
However at 1924 a transition to a new configur ation of the solar dynamo system occurred 
[1] that seated this system in the XX century Gran Maximum at which the highest values of 
solar activity of the last 400 years occurred.  T h e r e f o r e ,  t h e  s h a r p  i n c r e a s e  o f  g l o b a l  
temperature has been not only sy nchronic with the fast process of industrialization but also 
with a sudden increase of solar activity. 
At the Schwabe polar cycle #24 that started at year 2000 , maximized at year 2008 and would 
end at mid of 2013-14, a new solar dynamo transi tion is occurring that is leading to lower 
values of solar activity [2,3], and as a cons equence the flux of solar energy on the Earth 
atmosphere is decreasing fast. Therefore by observing the future evolution of climate variables 
we will be able to evaluate the relevance of solar activity variability on climate changes.  
A thorough determination of the contribution of solar activity to climate change is hindered 
by the fact that the only source of solar origin that is included in the climate models is total 
solar irradiance, TSI, for example see [4-8] Th is source of solar en ergy increased in the 
average in only about 0.13% along the last 400 years, which might explain at most a 30% [8] 
of the temperature increases along that period . However, besides TSI there are other sources 
of solar energy that might modify climate by  m e c h a n i s m s  t h a t  h a v e  b e e n  p r o p o s e d  a n d  
studied by the last thirty years, for a review see [9,10]. The aim of the present work is to 
assess the impact of the 2008 dynamo transition  on Earth’s surface temperature. This will 
assist us to be well prepared in studying the unique experiment that nature is currently 
bringing to us, i.e. the solar dynamo transition  and its consequences for climate that will be 
now documented worldwide and monitored with modern technical means. This may  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 186 
contribute to improve climate models by indicating the variables that are ignored in those 
models and that future observations finally prove to be relevant to climate changes.  
The prediction of the impact of the 2008 solar dynamo transition on climate relies in the 
prediction of solar activity af ter the transition. Based in the regularities found in the time 
series of sunspot maxima along the last millennium Schove [11] predicted a value of sunspot 
maximum #24 well below to those prevailing since 1924 and that fall near the low values 
that this cycle is having at only a year of its date of occurrence [12,13] 
 
Figure 1.  The predictions of Schove [11] for sunspot maxi ma #19 to #24 (filled ci rcles) and the observed 
values (stars) together with an estimation of sunspot maxima 24 for the descending transition (crosses). 
The thick line is the envelope of sunspot cycle maxima. The constant level is the sunspot maxima 
average as determined prior 1923 and the dashed line is the secular variation in sunspot maxima time 
series for a descending transition (from [14]). 
Unless in [9,10, 15] the only variable that is usually taken into account in the field of solar-
terrestrial physics for quantifyin g solar activity variability is sunspot number, of which direct 
observations does exist for the last 400 years. Th is variable gives a measure of the strength of 
the toroidal component of the solar magnetic field [16]. As solar activity ultimately depends on 
solar magnetic field strength [17- 21] all the variables related to solar activity must bear some 
relationship with sunspot number. However, it was found [1, 14, 15, 22] that this relationship 
is not linear and so we need to resort to other proxies than sunspot number that give a better 
estimation of the true variables. These variable s and its proxies are introduced in section 2. 
In our view, the success of Schove’s [11] predic tion of sunspot maximum #24 by 50 years in 
advance, is based in the fact that being th e solar dynamo a bounded system it undergoes 
natural modes of oscillation. However, the dynami cs of this system is described by a set of 
non-linear differential equations, therefore it s natural oscillations ar e non-stationary which 
impede us applying the Fourier base function  to describe them. A mathematical methodology 
suitable for the description of natural oscillati ons in solar dynamo system has been developed 
by us [2, 3, 15]. This method and the way on which it is applied to predict sunspot maximum 
#24 is briefly summarized in 3, and applied in  section 4 to determining solar dynamo natural 
oscillations in the variables defined in 2. The sa me method is applied in section 5 to look for 1950 2000

the signatures of solar dynamo transition in surface temperat ure and from these results and 
the analysis of the  latitudinal variation on temperature , that is presented in section 6, in section 
7 the impact of the 2008 transition on the evolution of surface temperature along the XXI 
century is evaluated.  Finally the conclusions are presented in section 8.  
2. The solar dynamo transition in solar activity  
2.1. The solar variables and its proxies. 
Solar activity has several manifestation, of these, those that are relevant to climate change are:  
a. Total solar irradiation, TSI. This is the only source of solar origin that is considered in 
climate modeling , for example, see [5-9]. To study it here we resort to the 
reconstruction from Wang,  Lean, Shelley [23-24].  
b. Solar Flares produce the hard part of the electromagnetic spectrum (gamma and X rays 
and ultraviolet radiation) and also solar proton event. We resort to quantify it the Flare 
index . Data for this index [25] exist for the interval 1976.5-2008.5  
c. Coronal Mass ejections , CME’s, that are usua lly going together with flares and which 
main effect is the acceleration in the he liosphere-magnetosphere system of height 
energetic particles [26] leading , when interacting with the magnetosphere, to high 
energetic particles events. To quantify the ge o-effectiveness of CME`s we will resort to 
the Sudden Storm Commencement, SSC, index as  defined by Duhau [27] that is based 
in the amplitude and rise time of geomagnetic storm sudden commencement, defined 
by Mayaud [28], and computed in the interval 1868-1998 from the ISGI data [29] . 
d. Variability of the solar coronal magnetic field, the solar ‘open flux’ that modulates 
cosmic ray particles flux. The solar open flux is well described by the geomagnetic 
index aa [30] defined by Mayaud [31]. The data in the interval 1844-1985 is from [32] 
and from 1986 onward there are two version of  this inde x , one is the standard from 
ISGI [29]and the other is the data from [33]. 
Solar activity ultimately depends on solar magnetic field variations, that has two 
components: the toroidal and the poloidal one [17, 21]. Since now on we will call ‘strength’ 
of the polaidal and toroidal field to the amp litude of the Schwabe cycle on the respective 
solar magnetic field component. 
The sunspot number gives a measure of the tota l toroidal field at the spots [16]. Therefore 
sunspot number at solar maximum, Rmax, is a measure of the strength of this component. 
While at solar minimum the polar field is mainly  dipolar and the open flux is coming mostly 
from this field , as a result geomagnetic index aa at solar minimum, aamin, gives a measure 
of the dipolar field of the Sun [2, 15, 34-37]  
Rmax is determined here from the yearly values of Group Sunspot Number [38] and of 
sunspot number International time series value as provided by NOAA [39] for the intervals 
1610-1704 an1705-2011 respectively. Aamin is dete rmined from the two data sets of 
geomagnetic index aa as detailed in paragraph (d). Note that while aa index is always a 
proxy for the solar open flux, only at solar minimum is also a proxy for the strength of the 
dipolar component of the global magnetic field.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 188 
2.2. The solar dynamo transition as seen in the solar variables. 
Rmax, and aamin fluctuated around  constant levels of 93, 4 spots and 10.3 nT respectively 
[1]. We have called these couple of constants ‘tra nsition point ’, that is a point in the ‘phase 
diagram’ of Rmax vs. aamin (as proxies for the toroidal and polar magnetic field strengths) 
(Figure 2).The transition point has the property that when the path of successive points in 
this diagram is close enough to it, a transition occurs in the solar dynamo system that leads 
to a sudden change in the strength and length of its natural oscillations.  
 
Figure 2.  The diagram for the period 1844-2011 per year for (a): the Standard data from ISGI and (b) the 
Lockwood homogenized time series data. (from [37]).  
There are three types of solar dynamo episodes: Grand Maximum, grand Minimum and 
Regular oscillations. Which of then occur after a transition depends on how close to the 
transition point is passing the path when comi ng back to that point. The paths determined 
by the two different data sets of Figure 2, pa ssed exactly (within the experimental error) by 
the transition point at 1924 and the Grand Maxi mum Episode of the XX century (red points) 
started. The same happened at the 2008 transition  for the data at the right, which indicates 
that a Gran Minimum is coming after this transi tion. But for the data at the left the path at 
2008 is far enough from the transition point to lead to predict that a Regular Oscillations 
type episode, alike to that occurring prior 1 924 (green points), would instead follows after 
the transition. From the properti es of the oscillations in proxy time series of Rmax from 
Schove [11] and of Usoskin [40] for the last 1700 years, we [37] have estimated that, among 
the two possible type of episode that may o ccurs after a Grand Maximum, the forthcoming 
episode would be of a Regular type, alike to the one previous to 1924 (gr een points in Figure 
5) and that this episode would endure for the rest of the present Millennium.  
A full sequence of the three types of episodes occurred since 1610 [1]. The solar dynamo 
transitions produces a sudden change in the average value of  the successive maxima of the 
Schwabe, ~11 year, cycle (Figure 3)  , that occurs in synchronicit y in all the related variables. 48 1 2 1 6 2 0

This indicates that a substantial change in solar dynamo configuration occurs after each 
transition that is affecting all the layers  that compose the solar dynamo system.

It may be observed that at and above the secu lar time scale all the variables have a very 
similar behavior, and so the corresponding osci llations appear having the same length and 080160Sunspot Number081624aamin 1620 1924 1724 2008     Maunder

nearly the same phase. The same do not happen with oscillations with shorter length, as 
much as for example, the two relative maxima  t h a t  o c c u r s  i n  a l l  t h e  v a r i a b l e s  a f t e r  1 9 2 4  
transition are not synchronic, but are at solar cycle maxima #17 and #22, in SSC and Flare 
Indexes (Figure 3b) , and at solar cycle maxima # 19 and #21 in TSI (Figure 3c). This is studied 
further in the section 4 and 5 by means of th e mathematical methodology that is discussed 
in the next section.  
The effect of CME’s and flares on the heli osphere-magnetosphere system is generically 
called ‘solar storm’. It is know that both ph enomena are often going together and in fact 
Flare index, along the short interval on which is known, follows closely to SSC index that is 
a proxy for the geo effectiveness of CME’s,. Therefore since now we will consider SSC as an 
acceptable proxy for the geo-effectiveness of solar storms. 
3. A base function of compact support for representing solar dynamo 
natural oscillations 
The Fourier spectrum of sunspot number time se ries, see [41] and references therein, have 
prominent peaks. The most conspicuous among them, like the Gleissber g, the Süess and the 
Hallstatt one, are usually called ‘cycles’. However, we do not know a priori the real nature 
of the phenomena that leads to these peaks and its variability. As much as to call cycle to 
any new peak that appear in the spectra of solar variables has been called by Hoyt and 
Schatten [42] ‘cycle mania’.  
We have introduced a methodology that allows sp litting solar activity related time series in 
natural oscillations, based in a study of the va riability on time of the peaks in the spectra 
and a suitable base function to represent the time series in real time, as is summarized 
below.  
3.1. Natural modes of oscillation in the wavelet spectrum. 
It is apparent in the time series of Figure 2, natural modes of oscillations in a non-liner 
non-stationary system, like the solar dynamo  s y s t e m ,  h a v e  a  t r a n s i t o r y  b e h a v i o r  w h i c h  
make it impossible representing them by the discrete Fourier base function, that 
presupposes that the waves are linear and stationary. As the solar dynamo system is 
bounded we still may apply a discrete transform method, but due to the transient nature 
of its natural oscillations the applied base function must be of compact support [43], as are 
the wavelet base function. The shape of the selected wavelet must be alike to that of the 
signal that is being represented [44]. The wavelet spectrum of the Rmax time series (see 
Figure 4) has peaks with a Gaussian envelope that indicates the presence of oscillations 
with fairly well defined periodicities. On the other hand, the variables as a function of 
time (Figure 3) exhibit oscillation with rapi d time changes in their amplitude. Therefore 
we have selected the Morlet wavelet base function that is a harmonic function with a 
Gaussian envelope.   
Solar Dynamo Transitions as Driv ers of Sudden Climate Changes 191 
The wavelet spectrum of sunspot number time series and its proxies have peaks at periods 
that goes from seconds, to millenniums. As the time series analyzed here is Rmax, 
oscillations with lengths below the Hale cycle length (~22 years) are not contained in the 
times series. Besides the time changes in amplit ude of all the peaks on the spectrum, at and 
below the lower Gleissberg band, the Fourier period of the dominant peaks changes 
strongly on time too, as an example of this we have computed the spectra (Figure 4) for two 
different time interval.  
 
Figure 4.  The Morlet wavelet spectrum for two time spans: 1665- 1865 (1) , 1865-2000 (2). The vertical 
bars delimitates the Fourier periods of the wavelet components that are included in each of the three 
period band. The colored numbers are the values of the Fourier periods of the nearest peak. Below the 
90 year period , only the most prominent peak within  a given period band is indicated, for each time 
span .  
For each of the spectra on Figure 4, the Four ier period of the dominant peak in the bi-
decadal band is the first quasi-harmonic of the Fourier period of the dominant peck in semi-
secular band. As the Fourier period of the domi nant peaks change from a time interval to 
the other, the length of the corresponding natu ral oscillation changes too. This is further 
analyzed next.  
4. Time changes of the natural modes of oscillations. 
We will study here only the solar variables that are relevant to climate change and that has a 
proxy time series larger than a century , these are TSI, aamin, that is proxy for the open flux 
strength and SSC, that is a proxy for the freque ncy and intensity of solar storms. As a result 
of the analysis summarized in 3 we have split th e time series in three oscillations (Figure 5). 
These oscillations are found by adding all th e wavelets components which Fourier periods 
are in the respective bands as defined in Figure  4. In the case of the secular oscillation the 
linear trend is added and the tran sition level is subtracted. A preliminary interpretation of 
the phenomena underlying the three oscillations is given in [3].  23 4 5 6 7 8 9 23 100

Figure 5.  The three solar dynamo natural oscillations (a): The bi decadal (thin line) and the semi secular 
(thick line) in TSI. (b) the secular oscillations in T SI , aamin and SSC, were SSC and aamin are scaled to 
fit TSI at the secular oscillation that produced the XX century Grand Maximum.  
The short Dalton Minimum that occurred around 1820 is the result of the synchronization of 
a relative minimum in a strong semi-secular (Figure 5a) occurring in  synchromicty with a 
relative minimum in a weak secular (Figure 5b) oscillations. Note that while the semi secular 
oscillation around de Dalton mi nimum has a length of about 60 ye ars, it has a length of only 
40 years along the Grand Maximum (Figure5a). Th erefore a increases of the amplitude of the 
semi-secular oscillation is synchronic with  a  i n c r e a s e s  o f  i t s  l e n g t h .  T h i s  b e h a v i o r  
dramatically occurs in the secular oscillation (Figure 5b).  
On base of the relationship between the leng th of the cycles and its intensity we have 
predicted the date of occurrence of solar maxima #24 , to be at 2013.5 [2]. And in base of the 
time changes of the three oscillations we have  predicted the value of sunspot maximum #24. 
After a descending transition, like the 2008, either a Grand Minimum or a Regular 
Oscillations episode (blue and green starts in Figure 6) may occur. These two possible cases 
are barely distinguishable between them This is due to the fact that sunspot maximum #24 
would occur at 2013.5 [2,12] and the secular osci llation passed by cero only at 2008 and so 
this oscillation will have only six years and a haft to develop. Only by sunspot maximum

5. Solar dynamo transition as seen in the Earth surface temperature  
To find the signature in Earth surface temper ature of the sudden changes on solar dynamo 
natural oscillations we represent the time series of north hemisphere temperature for the last 
400 years by the same base function that we  h a v e  u s e d  w h e n  r e p r e s e n t i n g  t h e  n a t u r a l  
oscillation in solar variables in section 4. By  adding wavelet componen ts with periodicities 
above the 17 years we include (Fig ure 7) the three natural modes of modes of oscillations in 
solar activity and at the same time we filter the natural oscillations in the climate system.  
The temperature increases since 1610 has not been steady but o ccurred in four steps (blue, 
green, red and violet horizontal bands in figure  7), three of them occurred in synchronicity 
with the third solar dynamo transi tion, and the fourth, that is s een in the surface data (black 
line) but not in the satellite data (blue line), started at 1970. The fact that each of the first 
three steps occurred in synchronicity with th e date of occurrence of the solar dynamo 
transition suggest that the increa se of temperature is linked to some solar variables that have 
had sudden increases after each transition. This a ppears to be the case of solar storms (see its 
proxy, SSC, in Figure 3b). Moreover, the last  s t e p  f o l l o w s  t h e  s u d d e n  i n c r e a s e s  o f  s o l a r  
storms that started at 1950 and reached a va lue that quadruplicates those prior 1924 at 
sunspot maximum #22, peaking at 1990. This is studied further in the following by 
analyzing the relationship between the secu lar and the semi secular oscillation in 
temperature with that in the solar variables.  1600 1700 1800 1900 200006012018093.4-13

The secular variation is alike in all the solar variables (see fig 5b). As a result, if solar activity 
were the main source of climate changes the secular oscillation in temperature must be alike 
to the secular oscillation in any of the variables related to solar activity. Only one of the four 
relevant variables, TSI, have a time series long enough to test this simi litude. The result is in 
Figure 9. There is a good agreement between th e secular oscillation in TSI and temperature, 
more if we take into account that the secula r oscillation in the other involved variables 
(Figure 5b) has a similar but not an equal time variation.

averages of paleodata [46] in the interval 1610-1849 to which ground based data [47,48] from 1850 
onward are pasted (dashed black line) The dashed  blue line is satellite UAH MSU lower troposphere 
temperature data [49] and the thick line are the smoot hed values (see text). The vertical lines indicate 
the dates of occurrence of the four historically docu mented solar dynamo transition (cf. black diamonds 
in Figure 3a). The projections of IPCC [50] for the forthcoming twenty years are shown for two cases: 
one on which the emissions of greenhouse gases would co ntinue at the same rate as today (full) and the 
other on which it would remain in the actual level (dashed black line) . 
The secular oscillation in surface temperature (F igure 8) started increasing above the secular 
oscillation in TSI at 1860 and re ached a value that is 0.3ºC ab ove the one expected from the 
secular oscillation in TSI. We cannot jump imme diately to the conclusion that this departure 
is entirely due to the industrial revolution, because it was not gradual, but occurred mostly 
in the interval 1860-1900 and after 1980, that is after the last two relative maxima in the 
secular oscillation in solar activity that occurred at 1957 and 1977 (see Figure 5b).  
A recovery from the little ice age (LIA) is oc curring since 1800-1850 [51, 52]. And, after the 
mid-1970s, ice mass loss has accelerated [52-54]. Th is is consistent with the suggestion [9-10] 
that the rapid increases of surface temperat ure along the XX century Grand Maximum was 
due to the increases in the frequency and intensity of solar storms which geo-effectiveness 
(see figure 3b), increased suddenly after the 1924 transition to quadru plicate its value prior 
1924 at sunspot cycle 22 maxima, peaking at 1990.  
The semi -secular oscillation in temperature and TS I (Figure 9) are alike. It is the strongest in 
SSC. After 1924 the semi secular oscillation in all the variables has two relative maxima, one 
prior and the other after 1970, like it happene d with temperature (see also Figure 7).  1600 1700 1800 1900 2000

6. An analyses of the latitudinal variation on temperature 
There is a hiatus in average global temperature in crease is recent years. This may be the first 
indication of the impact on climate of curre nt decreases of solar activity. However, at 
latitudes below 24 º (see Figure10d) the fast increa ses that started at all latitudes at 1970 , is 
still going on.  1600 1700 1800 1900 2000

Ice melting has accelerated since 1980 [52-54] and some models indicates that the ice 
feedback albedo mechanism due to this accelerati on is appreciable at the poles [56] and also 
at height latitudes [57]. This feedback me chanism is still not well represented in IPCC -101 (a)

climate models that underestimate Arctic see ice thinning by a factor of 4 and fail to capture 
the recent see ice kinematic acceleration [53]. From this we may conclude that, either ice-
albedo feedback is underestimated in the IPCC models [54], or some source of heating 
mainly operating in the polar cap and at high  l a t i t u d e s  i s  m i s s i n g  i n  t h o s e  m o d e l s .  T h e  
synchronicity between ice kinetic acceleration  w i t h  t h e  o c c u r r e n c e  o f  t h e  s t r o n g e s t  s o l a r  
storms (Figure 3b and Figure 9 blue line), th at after 1970, in only 20 years duplicates its 
strength , is consistent with this hypothesis , because these solar ev ents, when interacting 
with the Earth magnetosphere operates mainly in  the polar cap and at the subauroral region 
[58-62]. The mechanism involved are reviewed  a n d  s o m e  e v i d e n c e s  t h a t  a  7 0 %  f  g l o b a l  
temperature increases after the 1924 transition was due to this strong  i n c r e a s e s  o n  s o l a r  
storms are presented in [9, 10].  
If the above source of heating were significant, they may explain the step like appearance of 
the temperature time series (Figure 7) if we assume that not only after the 1924 transition, that 
is the only one along which a proxy, SSC, for th e geoeffectiveness of sola r storms is known, but 
also after any solar dyna mo ascending transition, solar storms  su bstantially  increases in less 
that 25 years, while it takes to TSI (compare blue and red lines in Figure 9) by more than 40 
years to reach its first relative maximum. At th at moment, following its semi-secular oscillation 
the strength of solar storms has already decr eased and therefore the principal source of 
heating at high latitudes is fading out. Ho wever, the ice is still melted and the secular 
oscillation in TSI is still at its maximum, so th e temperature is maintained at the same levels 
than before due to enhancement of the TSI heating by positive ice-albedo feedback. 
Solar dynamo is well over its cycle #24 and the average value of TSI (Figure 3c) is still well 
above the average prior 1924. The decrease of TSI (red line in figure 9) is being delayed with 
respect to the decreases of the other solar va riables. As was delayed its increases when 
emerging the Sun form the Maunder Minimum at  1724 (ccompare Figure 2a with Figure 2c). 
By the contrary, solar storms (see figure 2b), has already started decreasing by 30 years ago 
and will fall to a half of its 1990 values (sunsp ot maxima 21, see Figure 3b) by 2013.5, if the 
above mechanism sustain surface temperature woul d start decreasing in the near future. In 
the next section we present an estimation of this decrease.  
7. An estimation of the future evolution of surface temperature 
There are sources of climate change other than  anthropogenic gases and solar activity that 
are: 
1. Natural oscillations of the climate system an d volcanism. These sources vary in the bi-
decadal time scale and below [5]. To filter then we have taken into account oscillations 
in the semi-secular time scale and beyond.  
2. Time changes in the strength of the dipola r component of the geomagnetic field and its 
tilt angle, that is the position of th e geomagnetic poles, that modulates the 
geoeffectiveness of solar storms in the at mosphere [58-62]. Appreciable changes in 
geomagnetic dipolar field strength and its tilt angle occurs in time scales at and above  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 198 
the millennial one [63-65]. As a result the contribution to climate change of geomagnetic 
field along the current century may be disregarded. 
3. It has been suggested [66, 67] that periods of acceleration of the Earth’s rotation rate 
correspond to years of increasi ng intensity of the zonal circulation and to global-surface 
warming, and periods of deceleration correspon d to years of decreasing zonal-circulation 
intensity and to a global decrease in surfac e temperatures. A measure of the acceleration 
of the Earth’s rotation rate is provided by the time derivative of the excess of the length of 
the day, LOD, . This variable follows solar activity with a delay of 94 years [68] and so 
along the time interval analyzed in [66, 67] that is 1850 to1960, the semi secular oscillation 
in LOD was the strongest of the last 400 years, because it was the one around the Dalton 
Minimum episode. Only along this exceptiona lly strong semi secular oscillation LOD has 
appreciably contributed to temperature [10] , and so we may disregar d its contribution to 
the secular and the semi secular o scillation along the XXI century.  
We conclude that the main sources of global warming at the XXI century will be the 
industrial increase of greenhouse gases and solar activity. In view of the inability of climate 
models in reproducing present ice melting a cceleration and the mechanism that we have 
presented here by which solar activity increa ses might explain this phenomena, there are 
some possibility that the strong increases in solar activity after the 1924 transition was the 
principal driver of the climate warming of the XX century. However, as a careful evaluation 
of this mechanism is still lacking we can not ru le out the possibility that, by that contrary 
most of the atmospheric heating of the XX  century was of anthropogenic origin.  
In the case that solar activity was the source of the decreases of global temperature along the 
XX century, global temperature will start decr easing not later than about 2020 when solar 
dynamo will be fully settled in its new Gran d Episode. It has taken by 150 years for ice 
melting reaching current levels. After the 1924 tr ansition the increases on solar storms from 
the values sustained along the Regular oscilla tion episodes occurred in two steps, one 
culminating at 1947, and the other at 1997, but so lar storms has already decreased to values 
comparables to those along the Regular episode, that is at 25% of its value around 1977 in 
only one step, and the decreases in TSI to its values prior 1924 will culminates by ~2024 , as a 
result we expect that it will take unless a century to ice cover to be at the same level than 
prior 1850 and so, as solar activity will continue  with the moderate levels corresponding to a 
Regular Oscillation episode the temperature would be oscillating around the same level 
than prior 1923, that is -0.44 ºC, by  the end of the present century.  
In the other hand, in the case that most of the warming since 1970 were of anthropogenic 
origin the contribution of solar activity to te mperature change would be of -0.34 ªC . As for 
the next two decades [50] a increases of about 0.2°C per decade is projected for a range of 
SRES emission scenarios. Even if the concentrations of all greenhouse gases and aerosols 
were kept constant at year 2000 levels, a fu rther warming of about 0.1°C per decade would 
be expected. Therefore the heating due to gr eenhouse gases along the forthcoming 20 years 
will be between 0.2ºC to 0.4ºC and so the effect of solar activity would lead to the 
temperature stay constant or decreasing at the most in 0.1.4 ºC till about 2030 to start 
increasing again after that, unless greenhouse emission were severely limited in the future.   
Solar Dynamo Transitions as Driv ers of Sudden Climate Changes 199 
8. Conclusions  
The sudden increases of solar activity that occurred after the 1724 and 1924 solar dynamo 
transitions, has been accompanied by a sudden  increases of average surface temperature of 
0,2ºC , and 0.34º after 1974 and 1924, respectively . Therefore, of the to tal increases of the 
average temperature level, that was of ~ 0.8ºC al ong the last 400 years, less than 0.3 º may be 
of non solar origin, in agreement with previous results [15]  
A solar dynamo transition to a new Grand Episod e of lower solar activity is occurring, that 
would be settled at sunspot cycle #24 [1, 14 , 15]. It would be alike [37] to the 1724-1924 
Regular Oscillations episode. In fact sunspot cycle maximum #24 , that would occur at 
2013.5, is being the weakest of the last 100 hundred years [13], being alike to sunspot cycle 
maximum #12 occurring at 1883.  
Wile greenhouse gases emission continued incr easing at present, there is a hiatus in 
temperature since 10 years ago. This may be the first indication of the impact of the current 
solar dynamo transition on climate cooling. Ho wever, at latitudes below the 24º (North and 
South) temperature it is still increasing fast as much as there is a acceleration of the ice-
melting since 1980 [52-54] and some models indicates that the ice feedback albedo 
mechanism due to this accelera tion is appreciable at the poles [56] and also at height 
latitudes [57]. This may indicates that this f eedback mechanism is still not well represented 
in IPCC climate models, since they underestimate Arctic sea ice thinning by a factor of 4 and 
fail to capture the recent sea ice kinematic accele ration [54]. Or it may indicate that a heating 
source that mainly operates at the polar cap and high latitudes is still missing in those 
models, and, as suggested in [9, 10] this source may be solar storms, which after the mid-
1970s have duplicated their average intensit y and frequency as compared with those 
occurring at the XIX century. 
Natural sources of climate changes has been re viewed here, and from present knowledge of 
them it was concluded that in  the long term (time scales ab ove the semi-secular) the main 
sources of climate change along the past century were greenhouse gases and solar activity, 
and that the same would happen along the cu rrent, XXI century. The episode of Regular 
Oscillations in solar acti vity that is starting by now would endure for the rest of the present 
millennium [37]. If this prediction and the pr incipal source of polar and high latitudes 
atmosphere heating were solar storms, the sudde n decreases of the geoeffectiveness of solar 
storms to a 50 % of its values prevailing along the XX century Gran maximum will lead to 
global temperature to decreases from the pres ent average level of ~0.2ºC to the same level 
that along the 1724-1924 Regular Oscillation episode,  t h a t  i s  - 0 . 4 4 º C .  T h e  t i m e  t h a t  i t  w i l l  
take to the climate system to react to current decreases of solar activity sensitively depends 
on the ice-albedo feedback mechanism that is still not well known. An estimation of this 
time is possible by observing that is has ta ken ~150 for the recovering from the Little Ice Age 
[51, 52]. The fact that the principal solar source  of atmosphere heating at the poles and high 
latitudes has already decreased to its values pr evailing prior 1924, allows us estimating that 
the expected decreases in 0.64ºC would occurs  i n  l e s s  t h a n  1 0 0  y e a r s .  S o l a r  s t o r m s  h a s  
decreased yet to values alike to that preva iling at the XIX century, but TSI will decreases  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 200 
substantially only by sunspot cycle maximu m #25 (that will occur at ~2024), a appreciable 
decreases of temperature would be observed only by 2030.  
In the case that the main source of heating of the last 100 years were greenhouse gases, the 
solar activity decreases would contribute with  a  c o o l i n g  o f  o n l y  ~ 0 . 3 º ,  a n d  t a k i n g  i n t o  
account the projections of temperature from climate models [50] the sudden decreases of 
solar activity that is going on would mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases on global 
warming only by the forthcoming 20 years.

1. Introduction 
World paper and paperboard demand is expected to grow by about 2.1% till year 2020 and 
the growth will be fastest in Eastern Europe, Asia (except Japan) and Latin America [1]. 
There are two kinds of paper production: (a) us ing wood (virgin) as raw materials and (b) 
using non-virgin material like kanaf and bagasse  [1]. There are several studies that applied 
LCA in pulp and paper products (Merrild et al.,2008;  Murphy & Power.,2007;  Schmidt et 
al.,2007;  Holmgren and Hening,2005;  Dias, 2007;Wiegard,2001; Fu et al.,2005 and Dias et 
al.,2002). In their research they discovered th at energy and water consumption, Greenhouse 
Gases (GHG) and methane emissions,  chlorine and raw materials used for non-virgin papers is 
less than virgin material. This study focused on LCA of non-virgin material (baggasse) in 
paper factory in Iran. The Pars Paper Factory is a government owned factory and is located in 
Southwest Iran and is 500 m from Hafttapeh Suga rcane factory. It was established in 1963 with 
a production capacity of 35,000 metric tonne per year. Nowadays, the production of this 
factory has reached 40,000 metric tonne per ye ar. Hafttapeh Sugarcane factory was supplying 
bagasse to the paper factory. Water for this pr ocess is provided from the Dez River which is 
also near the factory. Source of energy for this factory is hydroe lectricity and mazut. Mazut is a 
brownish-black petroleum fraction consisting la rgely of distillation residues from asphaltic-
type crude oils, with a relative density of about 0.95.  
2. Problem statement  
Paper is made from plant fibers called cellulose, which are found in wood. Cellulose must 
be converted into pulp before being used to  manufacture paper. To begin the papermaking 
process, recovered fiber is shredded and mixed with water to make pulp. The pulp is 
washed, refined and cleaned, then turned to  slush in a beater. During the papermaking 
process emission can released into air and wa ter and caused the air and water pollution. In  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 206 
additional, nowadays, by rapid economic development and population growth the demand 
for paper also increased in the world. More demand on paper needs more harvesting of 
woody materials. Unsustainable harvesting of  w o o d  c a n  c a u s e d  d e f o r e s t a t i o n ,  c l i m a t e  
change, etc. However, producing one metric tonne of paper from non virgin materials such 
as bagasse, kanaf and bamboo can save 17 trees,3.3 cubic meter (m3) of landfill space, 360 L 
of water, 100 L of gasoline, 60 pounds of air po llutants, 10401 kilowatt of electricity [2,3].   
On the other hand greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) 
and nitrous oxide (N 2O) are critical components of th e earth’s atmosphere. Without these 
gases, the earth would be in deep freeze. Th ese gases act like a blanket, trapping heat 
around the earth and keep temperatures necessa ry for human life.  Ho wever, anthropogenic 
activities such as fossil fuel burning, land clearing and deforestation can cause ‘thickened 
the greenhouse blanket’ which means can effe cted on climate changes. This paper was 
aimed to identify all impacts of paper making process in Iran, using LCA as a tool.  
3. Pars Paper Factory, Iran 
Pars Paper Factory is a government owned factor y and is located in southwest of Iran. It is 
1500 km from Tehran the capital city of Ir an and 100 kilometers north of Ahvaz, 45 
kilometers south of Andimeshk and 20 kilometers from Shush. This factory was near the 
Hafttapeh Sugarcane Factory which supplie d the raw material for produce paper. 
 
Figure 1.  Location of Pars Paper Factory  
 
Environmental Benefit of Using Bagasse in Paper Production – A Case Study of LCA in Iran 207 
Pars Paper Factory was established in 1963 with  35,000 tonne paper production capacity per 
year. Nowadays, the production of this factory has reached 40,000 tonnes per year. 
 
Figure 2.  Pars Paper Factory  
As shown in Figure 3, paper production  process divides into three parts.  
 
Figure 3.  Paper Production Process  
In preparation of non-virgin materials, ba gasse was provided from sugarcane factory. 
3.1. Preparation of Bagasse 
Bagasse is the fibrous residue remaining after su garcane is crashed to extract its juice and is 
currently used as a renewable resource in th e manufacture of pulp and paper products and 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 208 
building materials. Using agricultural crops ra ther than wood has the added advantages of 
reducing deforestation. Due to the case with which Bagesse can be chemically pulped, 
Bagasse requires less bleaching chemicals than w ood pulp to achieve a bright, white sheet of 
paper. Because of this reason there is less im pacts of materials that used in the bleaching 
section such as Chlorine on the environment. The fibers are about 1.7mm long and are well 
suited for tissue, corrugating medium, news print and writing paper. Bagasse contains 65-
68% fibers, 25-30% pith, 2% sugar and 1-2% mine rals.  This factory brings the raw materials 
from sugarcane factory which is 500 meter from the paper factory .The raw materials send to 
paper factory through the pipe or conveyer be lts. The energy that use for transported the 
Bagasse to the paper factory is water or air.

factory  
 
Figure 5.  Transported the Bagasse through pipe from the sugarcane factory to the paper factory 
 
Environmental Benefit of Using Bagasse in Paper Production – A Case Study of LCA in Iran 209 
This is the section that separate fiber from th e pith. This process called Depithing. The paper 
production is continuously for year because of  that the factory store the Bagasse, therefore; 
the harvest of the sugarcane was on just 6 mo nths and factory storage the Bagasse as it 
shown in figure 6. The Bagasse has potential to fire so, it become wet to prevent the fire.  
 
Figure 6.  Bagasse Storage place in paper factory 
The Bagasse before send to the Pulp mill part mixed with water and send to the  
Bagasse Dewatering section to separate the pith and fibers. 
3.2. Pulp mill  
In this part there are five sections as foll ow: Cooking, Pulp wash ing, Pulp Screening & 
Cleaning, Pulp Thickening and Bleaching.  
3.2.1. Cooking  
The fibers reduce the water by cooking in th is section and the energy that use is steam. 
Approximately 10-15 minutes need to cook the fibers. This factory had 5 boilers however 
currently it just use 3 of them the re ason is the rest is out of service. 
3.2.2. Pulp washing  
After cooking process the remainder called Pulp  a n d  i t  i s  i n  b l a c k  c o l o r .  T h e  b l a c k  p u l p  
called Black Liquor, washed for thr ee times to change the color.   
3.2.3. Pulp screening and cleaning  
This was the third section on the pulp mill pr ocess .In this stage remove all the sand and 
useless fibers. It was show n in Figure 9 as below.

Figure 9.  Pulp Screening & Cleaning in paper factory 
3.2.4. Pulp thickening  
In this section, the pulp reduced the water around 12% in this stage. 
3.2.5. Bleaching  
The final section by using the Cl (Chlorine) gas and NAOH the  Black Liquor changed color 
to the white color and the process done in three times. 
3.3 Paper mill 
This is the final part in the Pars Paper Factor y. Final production is paper. Paper milling is 
the last process in producing paper. The pulp  will go through several processes to finally 
become paper. The paper which is white in color is cut to A4 size. At this stage, the moisture 
in the paper is reduced to 55-60%. 
 
Figure 10.  Paper Mill Process 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 212 
3.3.1. Stock preparation  
Pulp is insufficient for making paper so, in this section adds materials such as Kraft to 
improve the pulp. In this stage additional material such as Kraft that use for this stage 
bought from Malaysia or Thailand. 
3.3.2. Wet end 
This section is very sensitive in Paper mill so, it is divided to the 2 subsection as follow: 
3.3.3. Formation  
3.3.4. Press section  
After materials are added to the pulp it will go to the Flow Box and be spread on the mantle.  
During this process the pulp gives up some wate r and it is then sent to the Drying Section.

3.3.5. Drying section  
Wet paper after Press Section with 55-60% moisture passing from some cylinder .These 
cylinder heat with steam so, the paper will loss a ll the moisture. In this stage for improve the 
qualities of printing and surfacing of paper,  i t  p a s s  f r o m  t h e  C a l l e v d e r i n g  ( u s i n g  i r o n )  
section and cover with starch. Inputs for this stage are corn starch and resin. 
3.3.6. Cutting and wrapping  
This is  the final stage in the Paper mill .The cutting of the paper to size depends on the 
requirements of customer.

4. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) 
LCA is the assessment of the environmenta l impacts of a given product or process 
throughout its lifespan [4].  Life cycle of a product include four main stages; production 
stage, manufacturing stage, use stage and end- of-life stage. The environmental evaluation 
using the LCA approach is done by applying fo ur steps; defining the goal and scope of the 
study, establishing a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) and 
finally interpretation of environmental bu rden associated with the product [5]. 
4.1. Goal and scope definition 
The goals of the LCA study are to : 
i. Evaluate the environmental performance of paper manufacturing process, and  
ii. Identify inputs that have environmental potential from the paper manufacturing. 
4.2. Scopes of the LCA study 
x System boundary 
In this study, the A4 size paper commonly used for writing, printing and copying a 
document was chosen as an assessing subject in  the life cycle assessment. The life cycle of an 
A4 paper which starts from the raw material ex traction stage, production stage, use stage 
and end-up at the disposal stage. However, th e system boundary of the study only focused 
on the paper production stage (dotted line in Figu re 15). In general, the three stages of paper 
production are: preparation of non-virgin mate rials, pulp mill and paper mill process [6].   
x Functional unit 
The Functional Unit was set as the production  of one metric tonne of paper for one year. 
x Assumption  
In the LCA study, the following assumptions were made:   
There were no wastes or emissions to ai r and water nor by-products during paper 
production process and the transp ortation from each stage is not taken into account because 
of lack data. 
4.3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method  
The methodology used to develop this research includes observation, data collection, Site 
visit and interviews. Several approaches were used for data collection for this study, which 
are as follow: 
Site visit and observation: this was done by  visiting the Pars Paper Factory in Iran.  
Interviews: some interviews conducted for this research.

Figure 15.  Life Cycle of Paper and System Boundary 
Impact assessment is an important step in measuring the environmen tal impacts in LCA. 
SimaPro comes with a large number of standard  impact assessment methods. In this study, 
CMLBaseline2000 method was used for Life  C y c l e  I m p a c t  A s s e s s m e n t  ( L C I A ) .  T h e  
CMLBaseline2000 provides ten types of impact ca tegories with its unit as shown in Table 1 
The emissions inventory data are in terms of the mass released into the environment—such 
as 1 kg—per functional unit it also  means the im pact of a unit mass (1 kg) of an emission to 
the environment [7].

5. Results and discussion 
CMLBaseline2000 was used to analyze the pote ntial environmental impact using Simapro 
7.0 database. The graph is scaled to 100% pe r impact category, in order to allow the 
description of widely dispersed values per im pact category in one diagram (Figure 16). 
Colour difference of the graph is representing  t h e  d i f f e r e n t  t y p e s  o f  i n p u t .  T h e  n e g a t i v e  
value of the impact means benefit to the envi ronmental. The impact value for each impact 
was contributed from inputs that were used during the paper making process. In this 
factory, there were 12 types of inputs involved  in the process and had been analyzed. They 
were; Bagasse (farmed tree 1), Kraft (farmed tr ee 2), Electricity, Heavy fuel oil (Mazut), 
Water, Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Aluminum sulphate (Al 2(SO 4)3), Optical Brightness 
Agent (OBA), Chlorine (Cl). Clay, Corn Starch and Resin. 
 
 
 
Figure 16.  Impacts of paper production process from all inputs  
 
Environmental Benefit of Using Bagasse in Paper Production – A Case Study of LCA in Iran 217 
5.1. Abiotic depletion 
Inputs that Cause Abiotic Depletion Impact show n in Figure 17.  From the total, mazut (fuel 
oil) contribute the highest impact value of 85% followed by kraft with 11%, of the total 
impact. The resin, bagasse, OBA (Optical Brightness Agent), NaOH, corn starch and 
Aluminum sulphate make up smaller impacts in  a  r a n g e  o f  0 . 1 - 2 . 0 % .  C l a y  a n d  e l e c t r i c i t y  
contribute very little impact which are 2.90x10-3 kg Sb eq and 2.91x 10-5 kg Sb eq, respectively 
and this is the reason why these two inputs give  almost no impact value. It was identified 
that for abiotic depletion, mazut is the main input that contributes th e highest impact value 
while electricity was the lowest. In the paper prod uction process, mazut is used as an energy 
source for heating and steam-ra ising for furnaces, kilns and boilers. Mazut is a brownish-
black petroleum fraction consisting largely of di stillation residues from asphaltic-type crude 
oils, with a relative density of about 0.95. Th is means coal contains the highest amount of 
carbon per unit of energy, so it emits more greenhouse gases than the other fossil fuels [8]. 
The consumption of hydroelectric power will reduce environmental degradation because of 
renewable sources [9]. Electricity derived from fossil fuels can increase global greenhouse 
gases (GHG) while hydroelectricity or nuclear electricity may not increase the GHG 
emissions [8, 10].  
 
Figure 17.  Inputs Cause Abiotic Depletion Impacts 
5.2. Acidification  
Acidic gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen  oxides (released during  the burning of fossil 
fuels) contribute to the acidification of the soil and fresh water ecosystem. The category 
indicator for acidification was measured in kilograms of sulfur dioxide equivalent (Kg SO 2 
eq). Weigard, (2001) indicated that N 2O is produced naturally thro ugh human activities such 
as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, land-use changes and some industrial processes 
(Figure 18).

Figure 18.  Inputs for Acidification Impact  
5.3. Eutrophication  
As it shown in Figure 19, Kraft gives the high est impact (44%) in eutrophication followed by 
mazut (29%), starch (16%), bagasse (5%), Al uminum sulphate (2%), chlorine (2%), resin 
(1%), NaOH (1%), OBA (1%), clay (0.3%) and electricity (0.0001%). The enrichment of soil 
and water by nutrients is measured by the EP (Eutrophication) impact category. An 
increased EP could lead to algal blooms in lake s with reduction in sunlight penetration and 
other adverse consequences, and similar undesira ble effects on soil. Release of nitrates and 
phosphates continuously to fresh water and marine water can cause increased nutrient 
buildup. During the combustion of foss il fuels and fuel production high NO x is produced 
[11, 12]. This can result in accumulation of nitrates, phosphates and dissolved oxygen 
content [13].

5.4. Global warming 
Impact to global warming was measured in kg CO 2 equivalent. Figure 20 shows the impact 
value to global warming from each input. Bagasse gave a negative impact value which was -
130% while kraft gave value by -9%. Other in puts such as clay, st arch, OBA, aluminum 
sulphate, chlorine, resin, electricity and NaOH  gave positive impacts which are 0.02%, 3%, 
0.5%, 3%, 5%, 2%, 0.1%, 0.002% and 25%, resp ectively, of the total impact. For global 
warming impact, mazut contributed the highest impact value (25%) and bagasse the lowest 
(-130%). Weigard, (2001) illustrated that burnin g fossil fuels can release 6.2 (GtC) into the 
atmosphere each year. His study was done using LCA for quantification of greenhouse 
gases at Visy industries. Based on his research , Weigard, (2001) believes that changing land-
use (eg. deforestation) results in increased emi ssions of carbon. Likewise, the results of this 
study show that using bagasse as a renewable raw material for paper production could lead 
to less deforestation because bagasse has a negative impact on the environment. The 
negative value of the impact indica tes benefits to the environmental

5.5. Ozone layer depletion 
Ozone layer depletion was measured as CFC-11 eq uivalent. Inputs that contributed to this 
impact are shown in Figure 21. Chlorine contributed the major impact value with 62% and 
electricity the lowest at (7.8x 10-05 %). Kraft was the second major contributor (16%) and 
NaOH was the third (14%). Others made up a small range of impacts which was less than 
5% each; starch (4%), mazut (2%), aluminum sulphate (1%), OBA (0.4%), bagasse (0.4%), 
resin (0.2%) and clay (0.01%).  
Before the 1980s and early 1990s, free chlorine  w a s  u s e d  t o  b l e a c h  p a p e r ;  h o w e v e r ,  
nowadays, the use of free chlorine has ceas ed and chlorine–dioxide or other means of 
bleaching such as ozone which have taken over  [14].Chlorofluorocarbons (eg. CFC-11 and 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 220 
CFC-12) were first manufactured in the 1930’s but were not present in the atmosphere in 
any appreciable quantity before 1950. Up un til the 1990’s, they were widely used as 
propellants, refrigerants and fo aming agents. They act as a GH G in the troposphere but also 
damage the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The study shows that man-made chemicals can 
cause ozone layer depletion [8].

5.6. Toxicity   
The toxicity impact was measured as 1, 4-Di chloroBenzene equivalents/ kg emission (Kg 1,4-
DB eq). In the CML2BaseLine2000 method for LC IA, toxicity to human environment, fresh 
water, marine and terrestrial ecosystem were considered. Figu re 22 explains the toxicity 
impacts of the various materials/elements. Fr om the total impact, kraft contributed the 
highest impact of about 42%. Aluminum sulphate was in second place with 26% followed by 
mazut (15%), chlorine (10%), NaOH (4%), baga sse (1%), starch (1%), resin (1%), OBA (0.2%), 
clay (0.02%) and electricity (0.0005%).

5.7. PhotoChemical oxidation  
Figure 23 shows the impact value of each inpu t for photochemical oxidation. Bagasse gave 
the highest impact value in photochemical oxidation with 71%. Kraft contributed 14%, 
aluminum sulphate and mazut 4% each whic h chlorine and resin contributed 2% each, 
starch and NaOH 1% each. OBA, clay and electricity were at the lower and of the range at 
0.2%, 0.008% and 0.001% respectively.

6. Conclusion  
Based on the above study, following conclusions are drawn:  
1. Nuclear energy, hydroelectricity  or even using pith as a source of friendly energy 
should be used in place of Mazut for paper making. 
2. More environmentally friendly materials for bleaching should be used against chlorine. 
3. Paper recycling is to be utilized in place of Kraft to reduce the amount of impact of 
Kraft on.

1. Introduction 
It is the critical issues of the 21st century to achieve global scale 3E problems, which are 
keeping Environmental preserva tion, Energy security, and Econ omic growth. Recently there 
are several recommendations to affect national  energy policy. Climate change due to carbon 
dioxide in atmosphere has not been fully pr oved, but Precautionary Principle to reduce 
carbon emission has been adopted internationally because it will be too late to cope with 
disaster after a century. It is a time to take much longer time span for energy planning to 
cope with future energy crisis, which seems inev itable due to apparent limit of resources.  
Role and potentials of nuclear energy system in the energy options ar e discussed from the 
viewpoint of sustainable development with pr otecting from global warming. They are 
affected dramatically by different sets of ener gy characteristics, nuclear behavior and energy 
policy even under the moderate set of presumpt ions. Introduction of thousands of reactors 
in the end of the century seems inevitable for better life and cleaner earth, but it will not 
come without efforts and cost. The analysis suggests the need of long term planning and 
R&D efforts under the wisdom. 
New regime establishment has been discussed toward climate change in Section II. The 
feasible target for new emission scenario called Z650 (Overshoot & Zero-Emission) instead 
of traditional concept and energy mix against global warming has been proposed. Taking 
the effort for energy-saving as major premise,  c a r b o n  c a p t u r e  a n d  s t o r a g e  f o r  f o s s i l  f u e l ,  
renewable energy and nuclear energy should be altogether developed, which means energy 
best mix should be achieved, under the cons traint of keeping CO2 concentration in the 
atmosphere around 450ppm. 
Energy security problems and nuclear role have been also discussed in Section III. The basic 
overview of energy security and method of evaluation are reorganized. Energy security  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 226 
which had wide conception is indicated by me thod that compares the energy security level 
in each country. The role and potential of nu clear power from the viewpoint of the energy 
security is an important poin t to examine the direction and the role of the nuclear power 
industry in the future. It is un derstood that the energy security  is severely affected by the 
case without nuclear energy.  
Energy issue and nuclear energy role after the Fukushima Daiichi Accident has been further 
examined in Section IV. The root causes an d countermeasures of the Fukushima Daiichi 
Accident are described and the direction for en ergy and nuclear power after the accident is 
discussed.  
The path and key issues for "Sustainable development" has been summarized in Section 
V. Nuclear power and renewable energy sh ould be two wheels towards low carbon 
societies against global warming with economic growth and with avoiding energy 
security problem. 
2. Toward a new climate change regime establishment  
2.1. Climate change history 
In order to address climate change, most countries joined the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in early 1990s to examine how to reduce 
global warming. The Third Conference of Part ies (COP3) took place in 1997, and adopted 
the principle update to the treaty, the Kyot o Protocol. In the protocol, industrialized 
countries and economies in transition (Annex I countries) committed to reduce their 
aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by about 5.2% during the period of 2008-2012 (so 
called the first commitment period) compared  to 1990 emission levels. With the coming 
up of the expiration date of the first commitment period, the post-2012 climate regime has 
been examined during recent years. According to the Bali Action Plan adopted at the 
COP13 in 2007, intensive negotiations aimed at  urgently enhancing th e implementation of 
the Convention up to and beyond 2012 have been conducted during 2008 and 2009. 
However, the COP15 taking place in Copenhagen in December 2009 failed to produce an 
international agreement involving binding gr eenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. 
From then on, the international negotiation on climate change fell into a chaotic state. The 
COP16 held in Cancun in the end of 2010 and the COP17 held in Durban in the end of 
2011 adopted the Cancun Agreements and th e Durban Agreements that consist of 
significant decisions by the international community. The agreements represent key steps 
forward in capturing plans to reduce GHG emissions and to help developing countries 
protect themselves from climat e impacts. However, the framework of the climate regime 
has not been clarified. 
Fruitless negotiations on international binding scheme of GHG emissions reduction 
illustrate that the absence of a common vision become the biggest obstacle of combating 
global warming. It is time for us to go back to the beginning of the issue to consider what 
kind of world we can share.  
Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 227 
2.2. Global emission pathway 
In general, the base of the climate regime combating global warming is that it is necessary to 
limit the global surface temperature to 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels (so called “2°C 
target”). In the Copenhagen Accord and fo llowing COP Agreements , this target was 
reconfirmed. Based on the target and the four th assessment report of IPCC, the G8 Summit 
(Declaration 2007, 2008 and 2009) argued that  t h e  w o r l d w i d e  g r e e n h o u s e  g a s  e m i s s i o n s  
must be reduced by at least 50% in 2050 compar ed to the levels of 1990 or recent years. 
However, the ambitious argument failed to get global consensus due to the strong 
opposition by most developing countries who claimed that the reduction plan did not have 
sufficient scientific background and did not le ave enough space for their economic growth. 
Therefore, it is necessary to  r e e x a m i n e  t h e  s c i e n t i f i c  a n a l y s es of the climate change for 
developing a reliable emission pathway which can be accepted worldwide. 
Employing the schemes of zero  emission and overshoot, a research group developed a new 
stabilization concept named “Zero-emission Stabilization (Z-Stabilization)” instead of the 
traditional equilibrium stabilization. Their researches (Matsuno et al., in [1]) documented 
that the Z-Stabilization could avoid long-ter m risks while meeting short term need of 
relatively large emissions. Based on the new concept of stabilization and the 2°C target, a 
global GHG emission scenario named Z650 wa s proposed (Figure. 1). The scenario was 
designed based on two assumptions, one is that the amount of cumulative CO 2 emissions in 
the 21st century would be 650GtC equivalent, the ot her is that the zero-emission would be 
achieved in 2160. Some recent researches (e.g., UKCCC, 2008 [2]; Allen et al., 2009 [3]) also 
employed the concept of zero emission or near  z e r o  e m i s s i o n  f o r  s e e k i n g  b e s t  o p t i o n s  o f  
climate change mitigation. These researches suggest, from practical viewpoint, that a 
functional form with a peak within several decades following by monotonic decrease to 
approach to zero is necessary for a reliable emission pathway. 
The performance of the designed Z650 scenario was examined, along with a typical 450ppm 
equilibrium stabilization scenario (E450), though projection experiment by using a simplified 
climate system model. Figure 2 show s the emission pathways (a), the CO 2 concentrations (b), the 
global temperature rises from the pre-industrial pe riod (c), and the sea level rises due to thermal 
expansion (d) of the two scenarios. The CO 2 concentration under the Z650 scenario increases 
more rapidly, exceeds 450ppm in about 2030, and goes to its peak of about 480ppm around 2070 
due to the lager amount of emissions during the early period of 21st c e n t u r y .  I t  d e c l i n e s  
thereafter because the emission will be less than  the natural absorption, crosses the 450ppm line 
around 2160, and goes down steadily. In contra st the concentration under E450 scenario stays 
below 450ppm, and increases steadily to approach  the final equilibrium state. As a result, the 
maximum temperature rise under Z650 scenario is 1.8°C at around 2100 (if all GHG was taken 
into account, the peak value would be 2.3°C). Th e peak will last only se veral decades, and then 
the temperature will decrease to a stable state (1.7°C higher than the pre-industrial level). At 
meanwhile, almost no significant difference of sea level rise occurs between the two scenarios. 
These results obtained through the projection experiment indicate that the proposed Z650 
scenario could be a new solution on combating climate chan ge given by science. According to  
Global Warming – Impacts and Future Perspective 228 
the Z650 scenario, the global CO2 emissions will peak between 2020 and 2030 with a ratio of 
approximate 1.3 and decrease to around 0.75 in 2050 compared to 2005 level.

2.3. Optimal way toward the global vision 
In order to examine the technical feasibility of  the Z650 scenario and investigate the optimal 
way to realize it, numerical experiments of global energy system optimization using GRAPE 
(Global Relationship Assessment to Protect the Environment) model (Kurosawa et al., 1999 
in [4]) were conducted. Fifteen regions were se t in the model to cover the global aggregate, 
those are: United States, Western Europe, Japa n, Canada, Oceania, Russia, Central Europe, 
East Europe, China, India, ASEAN countries,  M i d d l e  E a s t  a n d  N o r t h e r n  A f r i c a ,  S o u t h e r n  
Africa, Brazil, and Latin America. The former  8  r e g i o n s  w e r e  d e f i n e d  a s  i n d u s t r i a l i z e d  
countries, and the rest regions were defined as developing countries. The final energy 
demands for every region were assumed based on population and ec onomic growth, while 
the technology assumptions were examined based on previous researches. The cost 
minimization of global energy system was carri ed out to optimize the global and regional 
energy supply. 
Three main scenarios were analyzed for the pe riod of 2000 to 2150. BAU (Business as Usual), 
which is the baseline scenario of CO2 emission s, assumed no changes of current the energy 
and environmental policies in th e future. It is very  s i m i l a r  w i t h  t h e  R e f e r e n c e  S c e n a r i o  o f  
IEA (IEA, 2010 in [5]) (Figure.3). REF (Refer ence), which is the reference scenario of 
economic assessment, assumed that energy co nservation would be promoted according to 
regional capacities and conditions but no CO2 reduction policy. It has a similar performance 
with the New Policy Scenario  o f  I E A  ( I E A ,  2 0 1 1  i n  [ 6 ] )  ( F igure.4). Z650, which is the 
mitigation scenario, assumed a global CO2 emi ssion cap based on scientific Z650 scenario 
described above (Figure. 2(a)).

2.3.1. Long-term energy vision  
The simulated global total primary energy suppl y (TPES) for the three scenarios is shown 
in Figure 5. Under BAU, the TPES with a large portion of fossil fuel increases 
substantially, triples in 2100 compared with the 2000 level. The TPES of REF increases 
slightly during the later stage, almost doub les in 2100 compared with the 2000 level, due 
to the influence of the regional energy conservation measures. However, the main 
component is still the fossil fuel. 
On the other hand, the resulted TPES of Z650 is the cleaner in combination despite the same 
amount with REF. In order to prevent global warming, the consumption of fossil energy will 
peak at 2030, and the clean energies, especially  the renewable energy will play an essential 
role during the second half of the century. As the results, portion of Fossil: Nuclear: 
Renewable is 5: 2: 3 in 2050, wh ile 3: 2: 5, in 2100. Regional TPES for Z650 is also examined 
as shown in Figure 6. In industrialized countr ies, total primary energy is almost constant up 
to 2100, where share of fossil fu el gradually decreases and share of renewable energy mainly 
increases alternatively. In developing countrie s, total primary energy continuously increases 
up to 2100, where peak of fossil fuel consum ption is around 2040, and both nuclear and 
renewable energy increase remarkably.

developing countries) 
The results for global power generation trends for Z650 are shown in Figure 7. In general, 
decarbonization and pluralization processes will be improved together. The fossil fuel will 
play essential role during early stage, but w ill decrease after the peak in 2040. During the 
second half of the century, it will cover less than 15% of the total power generation. The 
nuclear energy will increase constantly during  the first half, and provide approximate 30% 
of the global power. As to renewable energies, large scale utilization of the wind power will 
start from 2020, while that of the solar photovol taic power will start from 2050. Both of them 
increase steadily till the end of the centur y. Together with the stable hydro power and 
increasing biomass power generation, the renewable energies will cover almost 40% of 
global power generation in 2050, and a portion of about 60% in 2100.

2.3.2. Energy related CO 2 Emissions 
Based on the global CO 2 emission cap of Z650, the global energy system optimization 
projected regional CO 2 emissions (Figure. 8). Emissions of industrialized countries peak in 
2010 and emissions in 2050 will be  reduced by 50% compared to 2005 levels. On the other 
hand, emissions by developing countries will  peak in 2030 at 1.6 times 2005 emissions and 
decline to 1.1 times 2005 emissions in 2050.

Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 233 
From the standpoint of regional equitability,  p e r  c a p i t a  e m i s s i o n s  i n  t h e  i n d u s t r i a l i z e d  
nations will approach that of the developing nations by 2100 and the CO 2 e m i s s i o n s  p e r  
GDP of the developing nations will approach that  of the industrialized nations (Figure. 9). 
The results for industrialized nations show that CO 2 emissions per capita and CO 2 emissions 
per GDP will converge around 2050. Global emi ssions in 2030 will be 1.6 times that of 1990 
(1.2 times that of 2005) and will be about 1990 levels. Compared to the REF scenario without 
CO 2 c o n s t r a i n t ,  t h e  r a t i o  f o r  g l o b a l  e m i s s i o n s  in 2030 for Z650 is 0.82. For industrialized 
nation the ratio is similar at 0.89. For 2050, th e ratio to the REF scenario for industrialized 
nations of 0.48 is similar to the global ratio of 0.46 (Table 1). As the reduction potential is 
higher for developing nations, the effect is larg er. In general, the resu lted regional emission 
curves reflect the differences of financial and technical capability among areas. These results 
provide useful information for global harmony.

Compared with BAU, emission reductions by  r e g i o n  a n d  s e c t o r  t i l l  2 0 5 0  i n  Z 6 5 0  a r e  
investigated. Among the regional emission reduct ions, that of the developing countries with 
substantial economic growth in the future occupies more than two thirds in the following 40 
years (Figure. 10). Especially the reductions in  China, India and ASEAN countries contribute 
31%, 13% and 8% of the total reduction in 2050 respectively. It means that the 
decarbonization in the regions with substantia lly increasing energy demands will hold the 
key to combat global warming. Among the indust rialized countries, the United States will 
contribute the most. Its reduction occupies 14% of global reduction in 2050. While reduction 
in Japan only contributes approximat e 1% of global reduction until 2050. 
The results of analysis of CO 2 r e d u c t i o n s  b y  s e c t o r  s h o w  t h a t  e n e r g y  c o n s e r v a t i o n  
contributes the most during the whole period (Figure. 11), occupies  4 2 %  a n d  3 2 %  o f  a l l  
reduction in 2030 and 2050 respectively. The se cond contributive sector is the power 
generation. It will contribute 25% and 27% of all reduction in 2030 and 2050 respectively. 
The carbon capture and storage (CCS) will play an  increasing role in later stage, contribute 
27% of all reduction in 2050.

2.3.3. Economic assessment 
An economic assessment was conducted base d the analysis of necessary additional 
investments and the fossil fuel saving. The analys is is based on the accumulative statistics 
during 2010-2050. In REF, the world will emit 1, 462 Gt CO2 during the 40 years, in which 
622 Gt generated in industrialized countries wh ile 840 Gt generated in developing countries. 
At the meanwhile, total energy system costs w ill be 232 trillion USD (in 2005 value) in the 
world with almost the same portions in indust rialized and developing countries (Table 2).

Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 236 
In order to achieve the Z650 vision against global warming, an a ccumulative emission 
reduction of 362 Gt CO2 is to be carried out, one third in industria lized countries and two 
thirds in developing countries. For the purpos e, total additional investments of 11 trillion 
USD are necessary worldwide, which is equivale nt to 0.28% of the global accumulative GDP 
in the same period. The data for industrialized  and developing countr ies are 4 and 7 trillion 
USD, 0.18% and 0.43%, respectively. Most of the investments are distributed in 
transportation and power sectors. 
At meanwhile, the additional investment w ill yield significant savings in fossil fuel 
consumption. The total fuel savings in the Z650 compared to the REF are 57 Gtoe of coal and 
32 Gtoe of oil. However, additional 26 Gtoe of  natural gas will be consumed. Calculated using 
current prices of the fossil fuels, the undiscounte d value of these fuel saving is 14 trillion USD, 
5 in industrialized countries and 9 in developing countries. Thus, in this case the additional 
investments could be cove red by the fuel savings during the following 40 years both globally 
and regionally. There would be a good balanc e between benefit and investment from the 
optimal energy mix. This assumes the technologies  to be used by 2050 are those technologies 
that currently appear to be feasible and are expected to be widely deployed by 2030. 
In order to evaluate the economic performance further, an additional scenario analysis was 
conducted. In the new scenario, which is so called Z650+, the emission cap for industrialized 
countries is added to constraint conditions a ccording to the G8 Summit Declaration. That is 
the industrialized countries will reduce their emission by  80% in 2050 compared with 2005 
levels. The projection results are also shown in Table 2. 
The accumulative emission reduction is the same, but one third will be carried out in 
developing countries and two thirds in industri alized countries. Due to the lower reduction 
potential of low cost in industrialized countr ies, the total necessary additional investments 
jump to 42 trillion USD, which is equivalent to 1.09% of the global accumulative GDP in the 
same period. The data for industrialized an d developing countries change to 37 and 5 
trillion USD, 1.66% and 0.31%, respectively. At th e same time, the fuel savings will be less 
than Z650, and will mainly dist ribute in industrialized coun tries. As a result, the good 
balance between additional investments and fuel saving is destroyed. In addition, the high 
cost in industrialized countries would not bring benefits to developing countries.  
2.4. Role of nuclear energy 
As mentioned above, nuclear energy will play an important role to achieve the proposed 
vision against global warming. It s share in global TPES will incr ease steadily during the first 
half of the 21st century, from approximate 10% in 2030 to  almost 20% in 2050, and will keep 
the level in the second half of the century. It will contribute more in power generation 
sector. Approximate 20% of global electricit y in 2030 and more than 30% in and after 2050 
will be generated by nuclear energy. 
In order to evaluate the role of nuclear energy, the analysis on two sub-scenarios based on Z650 
were carried out. One is NuPO, in which nuclea r energy will be phased out with considering  
Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 237 
Fukushima Daiichi Accident affect, that is no ne w plant will be built from 2020 and the current 
plants will be closed according to designed li fe time. The other is NoFBR, which means the 
technology of Fast Breeder Reac tors (FBR) will not be utilized . In usual case  s u c h  a s  Z 6 5 0  
scenario, we assumed that the FBR technology will be available and introduced from 2050. 
2.4.1. Impact to TPES 
The global TPES of the Z650, NuPO and NoFBR ar e shown in Figure 12. In the case of phasing 
out nuclear energy, natural gas including that fr om unconventional resources will be the main 
alternative during the first half of the period. However, large-scale introduction of renewable 
energies, especially the offshore wind energy, o ccurs during the second half of the period due 
to the limitation of natural gas resources. On the other hand, the absence of breeder technology 
does not cause significant influence to TPES duri ng the early stage. But the increase of nuclear 
energy utilization will be limited by the uraniu m resources thereby more natural gas will be 
introduced during the middle stage. Within the end stage of the period, similar to the 
characteristics in NuPO, large-scale of  renewable energy will be introduced. 
Anyway, Z650 scenario shows Light Water Reacto r (LWR) will play important role in the 
first half century, while FBR, latter half. 
2.4.2. Impact to power generation 
Figure 13 illustrates the projection results of the global power generation for the Z650, NuPO 
and NoFBR. In general, similar portfolio is necessary for both NuPO  a n d  N o F B R  c o m p a r e d  
with Z650. The natural gas, biomass and wind en ergy will be the main alternatives to nuclear 
energy during the early stage. While natural gas wi th CCS, solar energy and fuel cell will be the 
main alternatives during the late stage. Howeve r, the scales of introducing these technologies 
are smaller in NoFBR compared with NuPO due to  the availability of LWR. And the more coal 
can be used through the technology of IGCC with CCS during the middle stage. According to 
the technology portfolio, the global average costs for power generation in NuPO are much 
higher than in Z650 during the whole period and w ill be almost twice in 2100 (Figure. 14). On 
the other hand, the global average costs for power generation in NoFBR are not significantly 
different with those in Z650 till around 2060. However, it will increase rapidly during the end 
stage in the case of NoFBR, and will be approx imately 50% higher than in Z650 (Figure. 14). 
2.4.3. Economic impact 
The same economic assessments as for Z650 are performed for NuPO. Compared to the Z650 
scenario, global total additional investment through 2050 would increase from 11 trillion USD 
to 17 trillion USD while benefits from fuel saving would decline from 14 trillion USD to 9 
trillion USD. The additional investment and fu el savings are 6 trillion USD and 5 trillion USD 
for industrialized countries, 11 trillion USD an d 4 trillion USD for developing countries. These 
results indicate that the more negative impacts will happen in developing  countries. There is 
no significant difference between the economic performance of NoFBR and Z650 till 2050.

3. Energy security problems 
3.1. Energy security history 
It is the biggest problem of the 21st century to achieve global scale 3E problems, which are 
keeping Environmental preserva tion, Economic growth, and En ergy security. Recently there 
are several recommendations to affect national en ergy policy. For instance in Japan, the role 
and progress of nuclear is expected to solve the global warming up, by Council for Science 
and Technology Policy, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Agency of Natural 
Resources and Energy, and etc. 
Expert meeting on “Nuclear Energy and Security of Supply” was held for 
OECD/NEA/NDC, during Dec. 2007- Dec. 2008, in  Paris. One of the au thors has attended 
the meeting for Japanese Expert. The explanatio n, examples, and proposals are based on the 
meeting discussion [7]. 
In fact, there are multiple concep ts for energy security, due to the differences of the quantity 
of resources, density of energy network, or the needs of the times [7-9].  As broad definitions, 
under time axis or spatial axis, two approaches , divided to the long term on global problem 
and short term on each area problem, are advo cated in the paper. The problem of short term 
on each area is recognized as definition of  energy security of narrow meaning in general, 
which are further categorized into incidental (temporal) problem and structural problem.  
The model is popular for poor resource countries to evaluate security risk based on the 
imported energy resources portfolio methodology which targets to energy best mix. Several 
evaluations of energy securities such in Europe  a n d  J a p a n  a r e  d i s c u s s e d  [ 7 - 9 ] .  A s  s p e c i f i c  
example of evaluation, the evaluation process is shown how to evaluate the security risk 
from the five points of view, energy efficien cy, diversification index of energy resource 
portfolio, energy resource dependency from Middle  East and Russia, self-sufficiency ratio in 
the primary energy supply, and CO2 emission  i n d e x .  T h e  c o m p a r i s o n  r e s u l t s  a r e  a l s o  
indicated in seven developed countries belong to OECD. Furthermore, the study of nuclear  
Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 241 
role from the viewpoint of different results of  nuclear existence or not is discussed [8]. The 
Scenario Planning analysis of "Two Ch ina in 2015" is also introduced [10].  
3.2. Concept of energy security 
3.2.1. Energy resources 
Figure 15 shows evolution of primary energy stru cture, shares of oil and gas, coal, and non-
fossil sources, in percent, historical development from 1850 to 1990 (triangles) and in 
scenarios to 2020 (open circles), 2050 (diamonds), and 2100 (closed circles) [11]. Three cases 
as follows are indicated in the figure; 
Case A includes three high-growth scenarios, 
Case B has a single middle-course scenario, and 
Case C is the most challenging. 
The primary energy had changed to coal of fossil fuels from firewood which is originated by 
solar energy since the Industrial Revolution, sh ift to oil occurred in the 20th century, and 
then it has come to nuclear power and fossil fu els in general in 2000. In  the future, to meet 
the challenges of energy resource depletion and global warming, it will be migrated to 
renewable energy and nuclear energy in any scenario. 
Table 3 shows energy intensity (electric power ge neration) for each electric power source in 
[12]. Looking at the energy density of various types of power, nuclear and coal-fired power 
plants are large and overwhelmingly 1 GWh/m2 /year, while renewable energy is very small 
about 10kWh/m2/year, renewable energy signific ant expansion in the primary energy ratio 
would be difficult to expect. It is expected to have the division of roles and complement each 
other, nuclear power as a back bone power source, and renewable energy as distributed one.

Discovery, production, and projection of oil an d gas with CO2 emission is shown in Figure 
16 [13]. Looking at the fossil fuel resources, whereas the amount of discovery peaked in 2000 
on the border, as shown in the figure, because the peak in demand is still ahead, it is 
expected to accelerate the decrease in supply.

Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 243 
As understood from Figure 17 which shows fossil fuel resources per capita [14], the oil and 
natural gas unevenly distributed in the Middle East and Russia, on the other hand coal is a 
large amount of endowment in the world mainly in North America and Russia. The 
challenge is anticipated to be significant that there has less abundance of fossil fuels, while 
increase in demand in Asia. It is growing aw areness of energy security in the countries of 
East Asia led by China is a matter of course.

Uranium, on the other hand, look at the next 50 years, initially is large in consumption in 
developed countries, from 2020 consumption in  d e v e l o p i n g  c o u n t r i e s  w i l l  i n c r e a s e  i n  t h e

2050 that also somehow with the addition of promising high-cost reso urces [15]. According 
to the simulation results of the authors shown in Figure 18, Uranium is consumed in

2020. The uranium resources are used significan tly in nuclear power, by the time 2100 are 
also likely to depletion [8]. For this reason, th e introduction of fast breeder reactors can be 
required as countermeasures as soon as possibl e, considering long Plutonium breeding time.  
 
Figure 18.  Uranium usages in the World.  
3.2.2. Major factors threatening energy security 
In a familiar concept, safety issue is a measure of  the risk factors that occur in good faith in an 
organization act in basically. In contrast, security issue, as seen in the information security issue, 
is a measure to risk factors due to external at tacks or malicious action in the organization. 
As a broad concept, there is a national securi ty. The underlying is to  e n s u r e  t h e  n a t i o n a l  
interests for the people as a nation in power re lations between nations. As they say, energy 
security and food security accounts for the foun dation of national secu rity. Apart from this, 
there are also domestic issues such as counterterrorism. 
Energy security, in a situation no one knows wh at will happen (risk factors), is to ensure 
sufficient energy source as a nation. World War II was said to be a scramble for oil. Another 
example is that the population to be able to survive is determined by the amount of 
supplied energy. In this way, en ergy is the backbone of the nation, and energy policy is also 
considered as a measure of energy security. 
In the OECD / NEA expert meeting, "security of energy supply and role of nuclear energy " 
held in 2008, the security of energy supply  w a s  d i s c u s s e d  [ 7 ] .  A t  t h e  m e e t i n g ,  " t h e  
economics of imported energy, social, politic al and technical problems" were discussed. 
OECD / NEA has first announced Nuclear Outl ook 2008 in 2009, in which the idea " nuclear 
power is alternative resource, and can be supplied by the countries that political stability is 
important for energy security" was also showed [16].  ྛᆅᇦࣥࣛ࢘ࡢᾘ㈝㔞㸦 㹁㹍㸰ไ⣙㸧

3.2.3. Definition of energy security 
There are different energy security concepts  i n  E u r o p e  a n d  U . S . A .  w i t h  J a p a n .  T h e  
important issues in Europe are electric po wer network in the community (EU), and the 
prevention of large scale black out, and fuel supply (Gas and Uranium shortage etc.). On 
the other side, the important issues in Japan are the improvement of self-sufficiency rate 
for energy import and making good portfolio of energy resources to be caused by few 
natural resources.[9] They are not opposing concepts between the Europe concept 
(stability of supply network) and Japanese one (self-sufficiency and market power). The 
diversity of defined energy security is to be indicated by nation or entity, for instance of 
U.S.A. which has electric network vulnerab ility same as Europe. Another example, 
regardless China locates in the Continent of  A s i a ,  C h i n a  i s  r e g a r d e d  t o  h a v e  s i m i l a r  
concept to Japan of the island country. For th ese reasons, it is searched for various and 
hierarchical definition to approach accurate analysis of security risk, and that the risk is 
also examined on time and spatial axes. Thes e multilateral considerations are the essence 
to measure security risk. 
The broad sense definition of energy security risk  is classified by time axis and spatial axis 
in Table 4 [8]. The short term energy security risk is narrow de finition of the energy security 
as it is called. It means energy security risk  happened in term around 10 years, and can be 
categorize in nation, area or global under spatial axis. The problem of energy resource 
supply from other countries, especially the approach to energy resources best mix, is one of 
the most important problem for isolated and few natural resources country, like Japan,. 
Expanding for use of energy by developing countries like BRICs is serious matter not only it 
causes energy resources conflict for other countries but it also brings out strong demand for 
keeping energy resour ces for themselves.  
The other hand, on long term around 100 year  p r o b l e m ,  i t  i s  t h e  g l o b a l  e n e r g y  p r o b l e m  
which are shortage of fossil fuel energy and gl obal warming. They are the most important 
issues in recent energy environment problems.

In short term energy crisis can classify into incidental (temporal) crisis like accident or 
terrorism and structural crisis like Middle East instability or expanding of energy demand 
in Asia, as shown Table 5 [8]. The measures are different in these crises, immediate action 
as typified by oil reserve and long term political solution as typified by resource 
development. 
 
 
Table 5.  Short term regional energy crisis.  
3.3. Evaluation method for energy security 
3.3.1. Indexes for energy security 
The most basic index of energy security in isla nd country is self-sufficiency ratio in the 
primary energy supply. The sel f-sufficiency ratio is 96% in  England and 140% in Canada, 
while 50% with nuclear, 8% without nuclear in  France. In Japan, it is 14% with nuclear 
power, without nuclear power, only 8%. Diversified index of primary energy is indicated in 
Figure 19 [17]. Balanced energy supply country can get low number, which means that they 
have achieved Best-Mix in energy resource. Canada has the most balanced energy portfolio. 
While China is indicated the highest number 0. 55, because of China relied heavily on coal-
fired thermal power. Japan is also indicate hi gher number 0.31 than the average of OECD or 
World (0.27), because Japan largely relies on oil.  
The Basic Act on Energy Policy in Japan poin ts out the necessary of energy resources 
diversification, that is one of the course to keep the steady supply of  energy. Table 6 shows 
that oil dependency in Japan on primary energy supply placed in high level as 77% when it 
is at oil crisis in 1970's. It takes still in hi gher level index (50%) compere with the global 
average (40%), now. On the other hand, Japa n continues to make effort to reduce oil 
dependency. It is understood that the rest thr ee items on the table become low level, such as 
the ratio of oil proportion to total imports [18]. Cause Consequence Countermeasure

Table 6.  Energy security index of oil dependency in Japan.  
On diversified index of region of crude o il import, Japan and East Asia dependent on 
Middle East heavily (0.7-0.9), while the index is  0.2 in U.S.A., 0 .3 in Europe and China. It 
means that these nation import from multi re gion and keep good balanced portfolio [18]. 
Basic Act on Energy Policy said, "As reducing ex cessive dependence on specific geographic 
regions for the import of primary energy source s". But 90% of oil has imported from Middle 
 
Global Warming – Impacts and Future Perspective 248 
East as shown the table which is the energy securi ty index concerning oil, in Japan. In U.S.A. 
it is also to become big problem which the diversified index to Middle East is rising 20% 
today. On the other hand, it is the problem that Europe depend 30% supply of crude oil and 
20% supply of natural gas on Russia. 
3.3.2. Share index models to prove procurement stability of energy sources 
According to the Kainou, energy security consists  of structural risk and individual risk of 
the conversion, production, and transportation  f o r  e a c h  p h a s e .  S t r u c t u r a l  r i s k  c a n  b e  
evaluated by the variance of its configuration [18]. Herfindahl Index of the formula (1) is a 
typical evaluation formula and is also  referred to as stable supply risk. 
 2(Wi: Share of each risk factor)iHW ¦  ( 1 )  
The method is shown in Figure 20 to evaluate  a comprehensive risk matrix which reflects 
importing region is unevenly distributed or wh ere energy source is supplied and so on. It is 
thought that this evaluation index is the mo st comprehensive energy security. According to 
this evaluation, "whereas the highest risk of oil energy sources, coal has the least variance 
and risk, and nuclear power is an energy source  that has the next least risk and has minus 
co-variance (small connection to other ener gy sources)" [19]. Judg ing from the energy 
security (without taking into account the enviro nmental issues), it is the best mix for Japan 
to reduce greatly the dependence on oil imports, to increase the ratio of coal drastically, and 
then to increase the ratio of nuclear power on the structure of primary energy, which can 
lead to minimization of risk.

Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 249 
Since uranium resources are distributed over co untries that are socio-politically stable and 
adequate diversity of supply is maintained (a bsence of apparent over-concentration of 
market power to specific countries/ regions), nuclear fuel is understood as less risky in terms 
of procurement than a number of fossil fuels (s pecifically gas and oil). This can be measured 
primarily by calculating share in dices. The method is shown in  IEA (2007) which is based on 
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is defined as the sum of square of share of all 
supply options with certain modification to reflect different socio-political risks.  Putting 
domestic fuel supply as risk-free, HHI is mo dified as ESMC (which stands for energy 
security market concentration), with: 
2ESMC , where Sif: share of import of fuel f from country/region i.ifS  ¦  
Since there are different degrees of socio-political stableness across countries/regions, ESMC 
is expanded to: 
2
iESMCpol = ( * ), where r : political risk associated with exporting country/region iii frS¦  
CRIEPI applied a similar methodology using HHI  and risk premium [19]. Under the Japanese 
context, inter-temporal evaluation of Japan’s primary energy mix was conducted, whose result 
is shown in Figure 21. The Risk Index in the figu re is a procurement stability index that reflects 
instability of energy mix induced from global re source distribution, glob al trade share, Japan 
import structure of each  e n e r g y  r e s o u r c e ,  a s  w e ll as socio-political risks of countries with 
resource deposits or exports. It has its maximum value 1 when all the primary energy needs 
are met solely by imported oil (in the same co mposition in the reference year, which in this 
case was set at 2005), while its minimum value 0 when the energy supply is preoccupied by 
domestic risk-free sources, such as hydro and other renewables. It revealed that the primary 
energy structure has evolved with remarkable im provements in its robustness since the period 
of oil crises in 1970s, through efforts to substitute  oil with alternatives such as nuclear energy 
and natural gas, also shown in  the background of figure. 
3.3.3. Multiple indexes model to evaluate energy security level 
3.3.3.1. Method 
In this section, the method is explained which was used in a comparison study of security of 
supply using five parameters among seven OECD countries using OECD 2005 year data 
[20]. Japan energy policies have stressed three targets: energy security, lower energy prices, 
and environmental protection. In  response to the recent structural imbalance of oil supply 
and demand, Japan has placed energy security at the top agenda of its energy policies. 
Review of the energy security level has import ance in formulating and steering the energy 
policies. Although energy security meant basica lly national energy security that puts the 
main priority on a stable energy supply, it is  required to consider energy security from 
wider viewpoints of global energy security, wh ich includes environmen t, nuclear concerns, 
international relations and others as its priority aspects.

Figure 21.  Historical evolution of primary energy mix an d its procurement stability index in Japan.  
The estimation is shown on energy security le vels of OECD’s G7 Summit member countries, 
which are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japa n, UK and US. These nations occupy 81% of 
GDP, and 76% of primary energy supply in OECD member countries. The energy security 
levels are shown by the scores of standard devi ation of the following factors, that is, are 
compared relatively for each country. Those sco res of energy security levels for each country 
are estimated by the following process: 
1st step: Select factors and indexe s concerned on energy security.  
The factors include as follows:  
1. Ratio of self-sufficiency of energy supply, for index of energy supply independence, or 
resource amount rich or not. 
2. Share of energy imported from specified areas, such as the Middle East and Russia, for 
index of stable energy supply, or of import risk by two big threats of political condition 
instability and marketing power. 
3. Diversity of energy supply, for index of energy best mix, which is calculated by ǌi Wij2, 
Wij: Share of respective energy i (Coal, Oil,  G a s ,  N u c l e a r ,  a n d  R e n e w a b l e )  i n  e n e r g y

3.3.3.2. Results 
The scores on energy security levels of seven OE CD nations for 2005 were calculated. The scores 
of Canada, US, and UK, resource-supplying countries, are relatively higher scores, compared 
with other nations, poor resource countries. Among the poor resource countries, Germany 
shows good diversification and France has good self-sufficient rate due to its high nuclear 
production capability, while Japan has low scores  for factors except energy usage efficiency.  
Figure 22 shows the trend of the scores on ener gy security levels of seven OECD nations for 
about 30 years (presented by five points) [8].  The method estimates energy security levels 
based on relative comparison. With a view on energy security levels of seven OECD 
member countries, the scores estimated by this method show that Japan is now placed at a 
lower level than most major OECD member countries.  
3.3.3.3. Survey of nuclear contribution on security of energy supply 
Nuclear energy has a great potential to improve energy security. Here, to clarify the nuclear 
contribution on energy security, a virtual worl d of ‘without nuclear energy’ is considered. 
Nuclear energy contribution on energy security  i s  i d e n t i f i e d  b y  c o m p a r i n g  t h e  l e v e l s  
between two cases, one is with nuclear ener gy and the other is without nuclear energy.  
This study excludes energy usage efficiency as an index for the comparison which is equal 
in both cases. Nuclear energy contribution is considered to be zero and then nuclear 
energy is allotted to fossil en ergy sources in propor tion to their respective portions in 
energy supply of the 2005 year data, for other indexes, diversity of energy supply, self-
sufficiency ratio, share of energy imported  f r o m  t h e  M i d d l e  E a s t  a n d  R u s s i a ,  a n d  C O 2 
emission ratio.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 252 
As the method mentioned in the previous se ction is used for comparison purpose among 
countries, only order is meaningful. To eval uate the nuclear energy contribution, relative 
value is used. Each index except energy usage e fficiency, which is not affected existence of 
nuclear, is normalized, where best one is un ity while worst one is zero in two cases. 
The comparison results are shown in Figure 23 [8 ]. Normalized scores of France with a great 
nuclear portion in energy supply become worse drastically, and those of Japan with scare 
energy resource and having nuclear energy pr omotion program, becomes worse also. Italy 
is not apparently affected by with or with out nuclear. Other nations possessing nuclear 
energy with rich energy resources would not be affected seriously.

with the discussion of experts of various fiel ds, enables the comprehensive understanding of 
the problem to be considered, the development of a robust science and technology strategy 
for uncertain future, and the evaluation of in dividual research and development theme from 
various aspects. This is an example of a structural crisis in Table 5. 
3.3.4.1. Master plan: Shared  awareness of the issues  
The research team conducts comprehensive analysis of risk factors, development of two 
scenarios with emphasis on ‘China’s future’.  Investigation of strategic viewpoints needed 
on science and technology and evaluation of individual research and development theme 
for each of the scenarios are also performed. 
3.3.4.2. Extraction of risk factors and determination of the scenario structure 
The fragility of the energy system of East Asia , with aggravating further from now on, has a 
large possibility to bring national power declin e and resource protectionism in the countries 
in East Asia. Such situation is a threat onto security of Japan, while it can also serve as an 
opportunity to growth national power and inte rnational presence of Japan, by advanced 
technology development and its technology transfer.  㻜㻚㻜㻜㻜㻜㻚㻞㻜㻜㻜㻚㻠㻜㻜㻜㻚㻢㻜㻜㻜㻚㻤㻜㻜㻝㻚㻜㻜㻜㻝㻚㻞㻜㻜

Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 254 
The two China images of ‘Sovereign Right Ch ina’ and ‘Open China’ were built and the 
‘Resource scramble scenario’ and the ‘Japan isol ation scenario’ were created from each in 
this research. As foresight which China image becomes dominant from now on is difficult, 
Japan needs to build a technology strategy with consideration of both possibilities.      
In extracting risk elements as the components of the crisis scen ario, eight risk categories are 
set as follows: 
1. China resource protectionism, 
2. China science and technology organization,  
3. geopolitics and international relations,  
4. energy infrastructure,  
5. motorization,  
6. electricity crisis, 
7. nuclear accident and nucl ear proliferation, and 
8. environmental problem. 
Although the elements mentio ned in this stage was 30 items or more, as a result of 
scrutinizing these further, to realization of a master plan, and 18 items were listed for an 
element with an uncertain prospect in this time as shown in Table 7. It classifies into four 
categories for convenience.

4. Energy issue and nuclear energy role after the Fukushima Daiichi 
accident 
The Fukushima Daiichi Accident raised a new challenge of securing the safety of utilization. 
National nuclear policies of many countries are being reexamined along with the safety 
evaluation. 
Safety design principle is “Defense in Depth” concept, which should be further reconsidered 
reflecting the accident causes. Usual system s focus on the forefront function, such as 
preventing damage, expansion mitigation, or incident prevention, while safety critical 
systems increases attention to back-up functions such as incident expansion mitigation or 
environmental effects mitigation, if it has a large enough impact on the environment. 
Common Mode Failure of External Initiating Even t such as Earthquake or Tsunami, which is 
usually Rare Event, or auxiliary systems failure such as Off-site Power, EDG, Buttery, or Sea 
Water Cooling loss is difficult to install to Defense in Depth design. 
According to the “Defense in Depth” concept reflecting Fukushima accident, we should 
consider three level safety functions; usual normal system, usual safety system, and newly 
installed emergency system including external  s u p p o r t  f u n c t i o n .  A n y w a y  t h e  d i v e r s i t y  i s  
significantly required for not only future re actor concept but also existing plant back-fit 
activities. 
Swiss Cheese Model proposed by Reason, J indi cates operational problem other than design 
problem [21]. Fallacy of the defense in depth has frequently occurred recently because plant 
system is safe enough as operators becomes ea sily not to consider system safety. And then 
safety culture degradation would be happened, whose incident will easily become 
organizational accident. Such situation requires  final barrier that is Crisis Management.  
Concept of “Soft Barrier” has been proposed here [22]. There are two types of safety 
barriers, one is Hard Barrier that is simply represented by Defense in Depth. The other is 
Soft Barrier, which maintains the hard barrier as expected condition, makes it perform as 
expected function. Even when the Hard Ba rrier does not perform its function, human 
activity to prevent hazardous e ffect and its support functions, such as manuals, rules, laws, 
organization, social system, etc. Soft Barrier can be further divided to two measures; one is 
“Software for design”, such as Common mode failu re treatment, Safety logic, Usability, etc. 
The other is “Humanware for operation”, su ch as operator or maintenance personnel 
actions, Emergency Procedure, organization, management, Safety Culture, etc.  
Premise here is that "Global warming and ener gy security are the invariant problems". The 
long-term energy demand and supply simulation to minimize the total energy system cost 
was conducted for energy predic tion during the 21st Century in the world [22-23]. Taking 
the effort for energy-saving as major premise,  c a r b o n  c a p t u r e  a n d  s e q u e s t r a t i o n  f o r  f o s s i l  
fuel, renewable energy and nuclear energy shou ld be altogether developed, which means 
energy best mix should be achieved, under th e CO2 constraint around 450ppm atmosphere 
[24]. Nuclear phase-out scenario, in which new nuclear plant construction is prohibited, is  
Energy Perspective, Security Problems and Nuclear Role Under Global Warming 257 
possible from the simulation even considerin g the issue of global warming, with the 
following problems; increasing energy costs,  l i t t l e  r o o m  f o r  c o u n t e r m e a s u r e ,  a n d  l a r g e  
uncertainties of technology. The role of nucl ear is also examined to understand energy 
security is severely affected by the case with out nuclear energy. Therefore, rational use of 
nuclear power is requested, that is each country should make decision, Japan and several 
European countries will be also phase out,  w h i l e  C h i n a ,  I n d i a  a n d  A S E A N  c o u n t r i e s  w i l l  
continue to be introduced. If the accident ha ppens again anywhere in, it will become the 
global phase-out. Therefore, rational unifie d safety standards (organizational structure, 
design and operation, regulations) should be reviewed based on the Fukushima Daiichi 
Problem world-wide analysis and established in the world. 
5. The path and key issues for "sustainable development" 
Figure 25 shows the path and key issues for "S ustainable development" [8], which is the 
target of the 21st century. 
x Stabilization of world population. 
x Reduction of the south and north economic difference. 
x Preservation of global environment. 
x Preservation and effective use for rare resources. 
It is necessary to improve economic developm ent and the living standard in the developing 
countries, as a fundamental so lution for the population grow th in the world and for the 
reduction of "Income gap between North and Sout h" also. It is necessary to secure energy 
that is low-cost and resource restriction free, to support economic in the developing 
countries. Moreover, great control of carbon-dioxide emissions is necessary to mitigate the 
climate change influence. It is necessary to achieve a worldwide spread of technical

6. Conclusions 
In order to address the biggest challenge to global sustainable development caused be global 
warming, a new post-2012 climate regime wa s examined to be sc ientifically sound, 
economically and technologically rational. The key findings are as the following. 
1. Instead of the traditional 450ppm equilibrium stabilization of IPCC, a new scenario 
based on zero-emission and overshoot sche mes was proposed recently. The essential 
limitation is that the total emission during the 21st c e n t u r y  s h o u l d  b e  l o w e r  t h a n  
650GtC. The scientific examinations demons trated that the so called Z650 scenario 
could avoid long-term risks. At the meanwhile it could meet short term need of 
relatively large emissions. The proposal improves the possibility of international 
agreement compared with the G8 Summit pr oposal, which argued that the worldwide 
greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by  at least 50% in 2050 compared to the 
1990 or recent year levels. 
2. A numerical experiment of global energy system optimization shows the technical 
feasibility of the Z650 scenario not only globally but also regionally. The obtained 
time series total primary energy mixes sugges t that the consumption of fossil energy 
will peak at 2030, and the clean energies, especially the renewable energy will play an 
essential role during the seco nd half of the century. The resulted regional emission 
curves reflect the differences of financial and technical capability among areas. The 
industrialized countries will reduce their emissions by 50% in 2050 compared with 
2005 levels, while the emissions of developing  countries will increase by 10% at the 
same time. The results of individual industrialized countries fit with the national 
targets well.  
3. The cost-effective analysis shows that the Z650 scenario is econ omically rational. 
Compared with the reference case, the additi onal investments in Z650 scenario could be 
covered by the fuel savings during the fo llowing 40 years (2010-50) both globally and 
regionally. 
4. Nuclear energy will play an important role for achieving the vision against global 
warming. Large-scale introductions of the more expensive renewable energies during 
early stage are necessary without nuclear ener gy or next generation nuclear technology. 
As a result, the power generation cost will increase rapidly thereby the negative 
economic impact will be significant especia lly in developing countries. Therefore, 
rational use of nuclear power is re quested to combat global warming. 
Compared with the threat from global warming, energy security is the more traditional key 
issue for global and regional sustainable de velopment. Based on th e overview of energy 
security concepts and existing evaluation meth ods, we proposed a new integrated index to 
evaluate national energy security from the wide conception. Case studies employing the 
index for OECD countries and China were conduc ted to evaluate the role of nuclear energy. 
The key findings are the following.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 260 
1. From the viewpoint of self-sufficient ratio, nuclear energy affects security index largely 
in the energy importing nations but s lightly in the resources nations.  
2. From the viewpoint of energy diversity an d CO2 emissions, the absence of nuclear 
energy decreases the security index significan tly by which influences  the sustainability 
of national economic growth. 
3. The nuclear policies of China will influence no t only the domestic economic growth but 
also the energy situations in the world,  especially the surrounding nations. 
Nuclear energy will play an important role from  the necessity of mitigating climate change, 
as well as improve energy security. However, the Fukushima Daiichi Accident raised a new 
challenge of securing the safety of utilizatio n. Following the safety design principle of 
“Defense in Depth”, three level safety functi ons should be considered for the hardware. 
Those are, the usual normal system, usual sa fety system, and emergency system including 
external support function. On the other hand, software for design including common mode 
failure treatment, safety logic, and usability should be improved together with the human-
ware for operation including personnel acti ons, emergency proced ure, organization, 
management, and safety culture. 
Sustainable development is the final target  f o r  h u m a n  s o c i e t y .  T h e  e n e r g y  r e l a t e d  
environmental issues and energy issue are the main challenges during the 21st c e n t u r y .  
Although the energy conservation is the most  i m p o r t a n t  i s s u e  i n  t h e  e n e r g y  p o l i c y ,  t h e  
utilization of nuclear energy is also essential to maintain the global environment and energy 
security together with the improvement of the renewable energy and the development of 
the carbon dioxide isolation technology for the fossil fuel. Therefore, it is necessary to 
continue technological development so as to demonstrate each potential as for the basic 
energy in 21st century.

1. Introduction 
Energy harvesting is the process of extracti ng, converting and stor ing energy from the 
environment that can also be described as a response of smart materials when they are 
subjected to an external stimulus such as pressure, vibrations, motion and temperature 
emanating from wind, rain, waves, tides, light  a n d  s o  o n .  T h e  e f f i c i e n c y  o f  d e v i c e s  i n  
capturing trace amounts of ener gy from the environment and tran sforming it into electrical 
energy has increased with the development of  n e w  m a t e r i a l s  a n d  t e c h n i q u e s .  T h i s  h a s  
sparked interest in the engineering community to establish more and more applications that 
utilize energy harvesting technologies for power generation.  
Some of the energy harvesting systems which use different sources to generate electrical 
energy and their efficiencies are given below; [1]  
x mechanical energy into electricity-generators  (20-70% efficiency), piezoelectric systems 
(0,5-15% efficiency) 
x chemical into electricity; fuel cells (25-35%  efficiency), primary batteries, rechargeable 
batteries 
x heat/cold into electricity; seeb eck-elements (2-5% efficiency) 
x electromagnetic radiation into elec tricity; photovoltaic systems.  
Piezoelectric effect is a unique property that  allows materials to convert mechanical energy 
to electrical energy and conversely, electrical  energy to mechanical energy. The stimuli for 
piezoelectric materials can be human walking, wi nd, rain, tide and wave etc. This effect can 
be an inherent property of the material or it can be imparted to an ex isting non-piezoelectric 
material. However, not every material can be made piezoelectric, only certain ceramics and 
polymers have the ability to become piezoelectric. Therefore, the chapter will contain 
fundamentals of piezoelectric effect, a historic al review on piezoelectric energy harvesting  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 264 
and recent developments such as flexible piezoelectric fibres which can be integrated or 
embedded into flexible structures. 
Since the sun is the most abundant renewabl e energy source in the world and the solar 
energy the earth receives in an hour is grea ter than the energy consumed in a year. This 
makes the photovoltaic (solar) materials one of the most significant alternative energy 
harvesters. This chapter will contain the statis tics for solar cell production in EU countries 
between 2000 and 2010 and also the electricity gene rated by photovoltaic cells in Europe in 
2010 will also be highlighted. The fundamentals of photovoltaic materials and different cell 
types such as organic, inorganic, dye-sensit ized and tandem will be reviewed in this 
chapter. The chapter will also contain an hi storical review on the photovoltaic energy 
harvesters, their efficiencies and the mo st recent developments are included.  
2. Piezoelectric energy harvesting 
One of the most widely used smart materials is  piezoelectric materials because of their wide 
band width, fast electro mechanical response, relatively low power requirements and high 
generative forces. Figure 1 presents a ma rket review on piezoelectric materials 
corresponding to their applicatio ns and market share (%) in 2007. 
 
Figure 1.  Piezoelectric devices market share overview on applications [2]  
As it can be seen in Figure 1, information tec hnology/robots is the leader of the market with 
31.7% global market share while acoustic devices and resonators have the lowest share in 
the market with 3.1%. The others in the global  market between these two applications can be 
given from high market share to low; semiconductor manufacturing and precision machines 
(18.6%), sonar (12.5%), bio/medical (11. 1%), ecology and energy harvesting (7%), 
accelerators and sensors (5.8%), non-destructive testing (5.7%) and miscellaneous which 
includes gas igniters, piezo printing heads and telecommunication devices (4.5%). It has 
been reported by Innovative Research and Products (iRAP) Inc. that the global market for 
 
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 265 
piezoelectric devices equals to US$10.6 billion and a high growth is expected over a 5-year 
period and to reach a value of US$19.5 billion by 2012. 
Energy harvesting applications for piezoelectric devices is less than 10% however it can 
change dramatically if the importance of piezoe lectric materials is reco gnised for alternative 
energy from nature with zero carbon foot print. 
Piezoelectric behaviour was first found in some crystals. According to historical reviews on 
piezoelectricity [3-4] Charles Coloumb was the first person who theorized in 1817 that 
electricity may be produced by the application of pressure to certain types of materials. 
However, it was only a notion until the ac tual discovery of the “direct-piezoelectric 
phenomenon” on quartz by Pierre and Jacque Cu rie [5]. They placed weights on the crystals 
and detected some charges on the surface and al so observed that the magnitude of detected 
charge was proportional to the applied weight. 
Lippmann [6] predicted that if a material could ge nerate electrical charge when a is pressure 
applied, the reverse effect may be possible so that a mechanical strain could be developed 
when an electrical charge is applied and this notion was then  supported by Curie brothers’ 
experimental results [7]. These two domains had been known as “direct pressure-electric 
effect” and “converse pressure-electric effect” until Hankel [3] suggested the name 
“piezoelectricity”. Piezoelectricity comes fr om the Greek words “piezo” and “electricity” 
that the word “piezo” is a derivative of  a  G r e e k  w o r d  w h i c h  m e a n s  “ t o  p r e s s ”  a n d  
“electricity” has the same meaning as English word “electricity”. 
Piezoelectric effect exists in two domains; namely, direct piezoelectric effect and converse 
piezoelectric effect. Direct piezoelectric effect describes the ability to convert mechanical 
energy to electrical energy which is also known as generator or transducer effect while the 
converse piezoelectric effect describes the ability of transforming electrical energy to 
mechanical energy which is also known as mo tor/actuator effect. The electrical energy 
generated by direct piezoelectric effect can be stored to power electronic devices and it is 
known as “energy/power harvesting”. 
Piezoelectric materials are member of ferroel ectrics so that the molecular structure is 
oriented such that the material exhibits a loca l charge separation, known as electric dipole. 
Electric dipoles in the artificial piezoelectric materials composition are randomly oriented, 
so the material does not exhibit the piezoele ctric effect. However, the electric dipoles 
reorient themselves when a st rong electrical field is appl ied as shown in Figure 2.  
The orientation is dependent on the applied elec trical field which is known as poling. Once 
the electric field is extinguished, the dipoles ma intain their orientation and the material then 
exhibit the piezoelectric effect so that an electrical voltage can be recovered along any 
surface of the material when the material is subjected to a mechanical stress [8]. However, 
the alignment of the dipole moments may not be perfectly straight because each domain 
may have several allowed directions. The piezoelectric property gained is stable unless the 
material is heated to or above its Curie temperature (T c). However, it can be cancelled by the 
application of an electric field that is o pposite to the direction of the material.

application of high DC electric field (polarization) , (c) remnant polarization af ter the electric field is 
extinguished.  
According to the definition of “direct piezoele ctric effect”, when a mechanical strain is 
applied to crystals by an external stress, an el ectric charge occurs on the surface(s) of the 
crystal and the polarity of this observed electric charge on the surface(s) can be reversed by 
reversing the direction of the mechanical strain applied as shown in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3.  Schematic of direct piezoelectric effect; (a) p iezoelectric material, (b) energy generation under 
tension, (c) energy generation under compression 
On the other hand, according to the definition of “converse piezoelectric effect”, when an 
electric field is applied to a crystal or a crystal is subjected to an electr ic field, a mechanical 
deformation on the surface is observed which is generally seen as a change in dimensions of 
the crystal. The direction of the mechanical  strain can also be reversed as shown in  Figure 4, 
by reversing the applied electric field.

Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 268 
Polymeric materials can be produced as large thin sheets and then can be cut or stamped 
into nearly any shape. They also exhibit high mechanical strength and high impact 
resistance when compared to ceramic materials.  Although the piezoelectric charge constant 
of polymers are lower than that of ceramics, they have much higher piezoelectric voltage 
constant than that of ceramics which indicates better sensing characteristic. 
Polymers consist of two regions; crystalline and amorphous. The percentage of crystalline 
region in a polymer matrix determines the pi ezoelectric effect. However, crystallites are 
dispersed in amorphous region in semi-cry stalline polymers as shown in Figure 5. 
 
Figure 5.  Amorphous and crystalline regions in the poly mer matrix; from melt  cast (a), during 
mechanical orientation (b) and electrically poling (c) [28]  
The melting temperature of a polymer is depend ent on the percentage of crystalline region 
in the polymer while the amorphous region desi gnates the glass transition temperature and 
mechanical properties of the polymer. As it is  seen in Figure 5 crystalline structures and so 
the molecular dipoles are locked in the amorphou s region. Broadhurst et  al. [29] studied the 
molecular and morphological structure of PVDF and its pyroelectric and piezoelectric 
properties. If a DC voltage is applied acro ss the polymeric piezoelectric material, the 
material becomes thinner, longer and wider in pr oportion to the voltage, conversely the film 
generates a proportional voltage when a mechan ical stress is applied either by compression 
or stretching. The relationship between applie d mechanical stress and generated voltage can 
be defined by stress constants.  
2.1. Comparing piezoelectric materials 
As it can be seen from the Table 1 the piezoelectric constant is lower for polymers as 
compared to ceramic based piezoelectric materi als. Therefore, when the same amount of 
voltage applied to polymer and ceramic piezoele ctric materials, the shape change of ceramic 
based materials are larger than polymers. Alth ough PVDF has a lower piezoelectric charge 
coefficient, its piezoelectric voltage coefficient is about 21 times higher than that of PZT and 
40 times higher than that of BaTiO 3, therefore PVDF is better for sensor applications. Due to 
being a polymer, PVDF is flexible, light weight, tough, readily manufactured into large areas 
and can be cut and formed into complex shapes. 
The electromechanical coupling constants (k 31) of PZT is approximately 2.5 times larger than 
the electromechanical constant of PVDF which means it is able to convert 2.5 times more 
mechanical stress into electr ical energy than that PVDF.

2.2. History and recent developments on piezoelectric energy harvesting 
One of the very early studies of energy harves ting by piezoelectric materials was performed 
in a biological environment by Hausler and St ein [31]. They claimed that a piezoelectric 
PVDF film and a converter coul d transform the mechanical ener gy caused by respiration of 
a mongrel dog to electrical energy. The piezoelect ric material was fixed to the ribs of the dog 
and a peak voltage of 18V was produced by motions of the ribs during the spontaneous 
breathing. However, the power generated was about 17 ΐW which was not enough to 
operate an electronic device.  
More than a decade after the study on animals, Starner [32] studied the possibility of energy 
harvesting from body motions by using piezoelectric materials. He claimed that a human 
body could be a source for harvestable electric  energy. Starner studied different part of the 
body, such as walking, upper limb motion, fi nger movements, blood pressure etc., and 
analysed the possibility of harvestable power from these locations. He claimed that the 
amount of power lost during walking was ab out 67W and by mounting a PZT device inside 
a shoe with an efficiency of 12.5%, up to 8.4W electrical energy could be generated. He also, 
suggested the possibility of storing the harvested energy by using a capacitor. 
Parasitic energy harvesting from walking of  a  h u m a n  b e i n g  t o  p o w e r  a  r a d i o  f r e q u e n c y  
identification transmitter was studied by Kymi ssis et al. [33]. They used three different 
devices which were a thunder actuator consisting of a ceramic based piezoelectric composite 
material, a rotary magnetic generator and a PVDF stave. Former two structures were 
integrated into the heel of a shoe to harv est the impact energy while the PVDF stave was 
integrated into the sole to absorb the be nding energy. The researchers constructed a 
prototype to investigate and compare the en ergy generation performance of these three 
different materials. The peak power genera ted by PZT unimorph structure was 4 times 
higher than PVDF stave, 80mW and 20mW  r e s p e c t i v e l y .  H o w e v e r, the peak power 
generated by the rotary generator was found to be only 0.25mW which was found not to be 
sufficient to power a radio freque ncy identification transmitter.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 270 
Shenck [34] demonstrated the harvestabl e power generation from a rigid bimorph 
piezoceramic transducer, which was integrated in to the sole of a shoe. Different regulation 
systems were evaluated. One of the findings was that the use of a second piezoelectric 
material leads to more energy generation. Furthermore, it was found that a bimorph 
transducer was more effective for the application since it was better adapted to various 
distributions of body weight and footfall velo city. Shenck and Paradiso [35] also studied 
piezoelectric PVDF and PZT structures embedded in a shoe. A power storage circuit 
which was designed to power a radio frequenc y tag was also mounted in a shoe and an 
offline forward switching DC-DC converter was developed. The experimental results 
showed that the switching converter harvested energy more efficiently –about twice as 
much- than the original linear regulator circuit. The whole set-up was successful to power 
low energy electronic devices since the switching circuit provided continuous power 
during walking.  
Churchill et al. [36] investigated the power harvesting capability of a piezoelectric fibre 
composite structure consisting of unidirectionally aligned PZT fibres of 250 ΐm diameter 
embedded in a resin matrix. It was found that 7.5mW of power could be harvested from a 
piezoelectric fibre composite material - with a length of 130 mm, a width of 13 mm and a 
thickness of 0.38 mm – when a vibration of 180 Hz was applied. In another work the 
possibility of power harvesting was performed by Renaud et al. [37].They studied the wrist 
and arm motions during walking. They found that a spring mass resonant system was not 
appropriate for energy harvesting from arm since motions caused by arm movements were 
low in frequency. An analytic model for a non-resonant system was developed and it 
showed that a maximum power of 40 ΐW could be generated from the wrist movements 
during walking. 
Granstrom et al. [38] developed a theoretical model of an energy harvesting backpack that 
can generate electrical energy from flexible piezoelectric PVDF films integrated into the 
straps. It was found that 45.6mW of power could be generated from a complete backpack 
with two piezoelectric straps with an effici ency of more than 13%. Swallow et al. [39] 
developed a micropower generator using micro composite based piezoelectric materials for 
energy reclamation in glove structures. They de veloped fibre composite structures by using 
different fibre diameters embedded between two copper electrodes and both the effect of 
fibre diameter and the materials thickness were  investigated. Their results showed that the 
composite structure was able to produce a volt age up to 6 volts. Siores and Swallow [40] 
developed an apparatus for detection and suspension of muscle tremors.

however it was produced by a multi-proces s method where a copolymer of PVDF, P(VDF-

3. Photovoltaic effect and photovoltaic energy harvesting 
The sun is the most abundant renewable ener gy source in the World. The solar energy 
which the Earth receives in an hour is greate r than the energy consumed in a year. If we 
need to present the situation by numbers,  the received solar power is about 120,000 
Terawatts while the global energy consumption is about 13 Terawatts [43]. 
 
Figure 6.  Number of solar cell production between 2000 and 2010 in European Countries [44] 
The importance of renewable energy generation increases significantly with an increase in 
global warming, air and water pollution etc.  T h e  m o s t  o f  t h e  E u r o p e a n  c o u n t r i e s  h a v e  
started using PV cells for their electrical en ergy need. Figure 6 clearly shows the dramatic 
increase in the PV cell production in Europe  over a 10-year period. Increasing demand on 
the solar cell production has shown a steady incr ease since 2000. This may be a result of the 
increased awareness of global warming and th e need for using environmentally friendly 
materials and techniques. The number of solar cell production in EU countries was more 
than doubled in a year between 2009 and 2010.  
Figure 7 shows the projected solar power generati on in European countries. It is clear that 
the largest solar power generator is Germany fo llowed by Italy, Czech Republic and France. 
Although Spain is known as a sunny country, the production of power from solar cells is 
almost 20 times less than that of Germany. Mo stly dull and cloudy countries like Latvia and 
Estonia pointed as “Rest of the EU” in the figure and United Kingdom have much lower 
solar power generation and their portion is under 1%.  
Photovoltaic effect was first observed by  A l e x a n d r e - E d m o n d  B e c q u e r e l  i n  1 8 3 9  w h e n  h e  
subjected an AgCl electrode in an electrolyte solution to the light. The word “photo” is a 
Greek word used for light and “voltaic” na med after Alessandro Volta. The beam of 
sunlight contains photons which may contain different amount of energy related to the 
different wavelengths of the solar spectrum. Wh en a photovoltaic material is exposed to 
sunlight, photons may be reflected, absorbed or transmitted. Only the absorbed photons 
with energy greater than the bandgap energy can generate electricity by causing the 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 272 
breakage of covalent bonds and dislodging of the electrons from the atoms of the cell. The 
free electrons start moving through the cell and du ring this movement they create and fill in 
the cell’s vacancies to generate electricity. The ability of materials to absorb photons and 
convert into electricity is known as photovoltaic effect  [46-47]. Two fundamental processes of 
PV effect, light absorption and charge separati on, are the basis of all inorganic PV cells. 
 
Figure 7.  PV market share (MW, %) in EU in 2010 and evaluation until 2015 [45] 
The proportion of sunlight energy is significan t for the conversion efficiency of a PV cell 
which converts sunlight energy to  electrical energy. The efficien cy of PV energy is important 
to make PV energy competitive with more traditional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels. 
For comparison, the earliest PV devices conv erted about 1%-2% of sunlight energy into 
electric energy. Today, it is likely to produce photovoltaic structures made of pure silicon 
with 24.7% efficiency [48-49] however, due to the rigidity of silicon based solar cells and 
pursuit of light weight and flexible phot ovoltaic materials for curved structures, 
applications are limited. Photovoltaic materials based on conjugated polymers, due to ease 
of processing, low-cost fabrication, being light weight and flexible, are evolving into a 
promising alternative to silicon based solar cells [50-51]. 
3.1. Inorganic photovoltaic materials 
The best example for inorganic photovoltaic material is silicon. It is the most commonly 
used material which absorbs light and creates electron-hole pairs. Th e individual inorganic 
solar cells are designed with a positive (p-junction) and a negative (n-junction) layer to 
create an electric field. When n-type layer is doped, the element wi th an extra electron, 
generally phosphorous, is used to give a nega tive charge to the layer. On the other hand, 
when p-type layer is doped, the element with a less electron, generally boron, is used to give 
 
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 273 
a positive charge to the layer. The place in between these two layers is called p-n cell 
junction. 
Electrons in n-type layer are free and travel through the material to lower energy levels 
while holes travel to higher energy levels wh en the photovoltaic cell is exposed to the 
sunlight. Free electrons jump ac ross the p-n cell junction. These electrons then return to the 
n-type layer when the two sides of the cell are connected with a wire and this electron flow 
is known as “the electric curre nt”. The Figure 8 clearly presen ts the layers of an inorganic 
PV cell and the generation of electr ic current by flowing electrons. 
 
Figure 8.  Layers and working principle of a silicon solar cell 
Crystalline, multi-crystalline, amorphous an d microcrystalline silicon, copper indium 
gallium diselenide (CIGS), the III-V compounds and alloys, CdTe, InP, Cu2Se, WSe2, GaAs 
etc. are mostly used as inorganic semiconductor materials for PV cells [52-53]. These 
semiconductor materials, used for inorganic PV cell fabrication, have energy bandgaps 
within the range of 1.1-1.7 eV which make them  desirable due to being near to the optimum 
energy bandgap of 1.5 eV for PV energy conversion  by a single junction solar cell [54]. Many 
researchers have concentrated on increasing the efficiency and achieving maximum power. 
Recorded efficiency for a free-standing 50 ΐm thin film monocrystalline silicon solar cell is 
17% [55], for 47 ΐm thin film silicon cell is 21.5% [56] and maximum recorded efficiency for 
inorganic solar cells is 24.7% [57]. 
3.2. Organic photovoltaic materials 
Semiconducting polymers with suitable bandga ps, absorption characteristics and physical 
properties can be used for the fabrication of  o r g a n i c  p h o t o v o l t a i c  m a t e r i a l s .  T h e y  a r e  
cheaper raw materials as compared to silicon based inorganic solar cells and they can also 
be fabricated by using cheap processing techniqu es. Photovoltaic effect of organic PV cells is

based on electron transfer from donor-type  s e m i c o n d u c t i n g  c o n j u g a t e d  p o l y m e r s  t o  
acceptor-type conjugated polymers or acceptor molecules, such as fullerenes [58]. These 
materials have donor-acceptor heterojunctions to achieve separation of the electron-hole 
pairs. Most of the semiconducting polymers are hole-conductors and known as electron 
donor polymers.  
There are six basic operational principles for a polymer solar cell [59-60] as listed below: 
1. Coupling of the photons 
2. Photon absorption by active layer, ΋abs, 
3. Electron-hole pair creation (e xcited state) and diffusion, ΋diff,  
4. Charge separation, ΋tc, 
5. Charge transportation within the respecti ve polymer to the respective electrodes, ΋tr, 
6. Charge collection, ΋cc 
 
Figure 9.  Donor-acceptor heterojunction configurat ions in a typical organic solar cell 
When the photoconductive prop erties of organic polymers was first observed, the most 
widely studied polymer was poly(vinyl carbazole ), PVK [61]. Other suitable electron donor 
polymers for organic photovoltaics include;  
x poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, 
x po5ly(3-octylthiophene), (P3OT) 
x polyphenylenevinylene, (PPV)  
x polyfluorene, (PFO)

(PCDTBT) 
 
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 275 
Semiconducting polymers have lower dielectric constant but higher exti nction constant than 
that of inorganic PV materials. To absorb th e most incident light about 300nm thickness is 
enough for a film material [62]. However, th e optimized thickness for most polymer solar 
cells is less than 100nm [63] due to the low carrier mobility.  
Electron acceptors with high electron mobility  are the most suitable materials for polymer 
solar cells. Due to exhibiting 1cm2V-1s-1 electron mobility [64], ultrafast photo induced charge 
transfer and derivatives of C 60 and C 70 are the best electron acceptor s so far. Suitable electron 
acceptor polymers for organic photovoltaics include; 
x 6,6-phenyl-C61-butric ac id methyl ester, (PC 60BM) 
x 6,6-phenyl-C71-butric ac id methyl ester, (PC 70BM) 
x poly(9,9’-dioctylfluorene-co-bis-N,N’ -(4-butylphenyl)-bis-N,N’-phenyl-1,4-
phenylenediamine, (F8TB) 
x poly-[2-methoxy-5,2’-ethylhexyloxy]-1,4-(1-c yanovinylene)-phenylene,(CN-MEH-PPV)  
3.3. Dye-sensitized photovoltaic materials 
The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC or DSC) ar e thin film photovoltaic materials. They are 
also known as “the 3rd generation solar cells”. The first DSSCs were studied by Gerischer et 
al in late 1960s who illustrated that organic dyes  can generate electricity at oxide electrodes 
in electrochemical cells [65]. The first actual work on DSSCs was carried out with a 
chlorophyll sensitized zinc oxide (ZnO) electrod e. In this work, photons were converted into 
an electric current by charge injection of excited dye molecules into a wide bandgap 
semiconductor for the first time [66]. DSSCs ha ve slightly different working principle than 
traditional silicon solar cells. Light absorpti on and charge carrier transport processes are 
separated in DSSCs. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer, which is affixed to the surface of a 
wide band semiconductor. Charge separation takes place at the surface via photo-induced 
electron injection between dye, semiconductor and electrolyte [67-68]. 
When a DSSC is exposed to the sun light, ph otons pass through the transparent electrode 
into the dye (active) layer and excite elec trons. Excited electrons move toward the 
transparent electrode where th ey are collected. Once an el ectron completes its travel 
through the external circ uit, it is re-induced into the D SSC on the back electrode and flows 
into the electrolyte and then  it is transported back to the dye molecules [69]. 
After the discovery of DSSCs in late 1960s and early 1970s, DSSCs have attracted many 
researchers’ attention and a significant number of works have been carried out on suitable 
transparent electrodes [70-71], and electrolytes [ 72] but mostly on increasing the efficiency of 
DSSCs [73-78].  
DSSCs have some advantages over inorganic solar cells as given below: 
x low cost materials, 
x the electron is injected  from a dye into TiO 2, there is no electron-hole pair, 
x DSSCs can work even in low density light conditions which make them possible to be 
used for some indoor applications,  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 276 
x DSSCs can operate at lower internal temp eratures even in a hot environment. 
 
Figure 10.  Dye-sensitized solar sell struct ure; transparent electrode coated transparent substrate and 
over it a TiO 2 layer sensitized by a monolayer of adso rbed dye (photo-electrode), electrolyte and 
counter electrode. 
On the other hand, the power conversion effici ency of DSSCs is lower than silicon based 
inorganic solar cells. There is also a possib ility of breakdown of the dye material and 
leakage of liquid electrolyte. 
3.4. Tandem cell photovoltaic materials 
Tandem solar cells (TSCs) are developed to ov ercome some drawbacks of conventional solar 
cells. Each active material used to fabricate a solar cell can only convert certain wavelength 
of the light to electricity. To achieve better ph oton absorption efficiency, two or more active 
materials with different bandgaps are linked to  built-up a TSC. Two or more heterojunction 
solar cells are deposited on top of each other to create a TSC. One of the photo-active 
materials with a higher bandgap collects photon s with higher energy while the other with a 
lower bandgap absorbs photons with lower energy (Figure 11). 
Since solar cells with different bandgaps are used, when the st ructure is built-up, 
semiconductor material with a wide band ga p is used as the first active layer and 
semiconductor material with a smaller band gap is used as the second active layer. When 
the individual cells are connected in series to create a TSC, the open-circuit voltage (V oc) of 
tandem cell is increased to the sum of the V oc of individual cells [79]. The maximum 
efficiency calculated for a tandem solar cell consisting of 2 sub-cells is 42% with band gaps 
of 1.9 and 1.0 eV and calculated maximum effici ency for a tandem solar cell consisting of 3 
sub-cells is 49% with band gaps of 2.3, 1.4 an d 0.8 eV [80]. However, experimental studies on 
 
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 277 
tandem solar cells consisting of GaInP/GaInAs /GaInAs showed only an efficiency of 33.8% 
[81] and 38.9% [82]. The maximum efficiency calculated for organic tandem solar cells 
consisting of 2 sub cells is close to 14% [83]. 
 
Figure 11.  Tandem solar cell structure consisting of two ph otovoltaic cells having different band gaps 
3.5. Hybrid photovoltaic materials 
To combine the unique properties of inorga nic semiconductor nanoparticles with organic 
polymeric materials, both organic and inorganic nanostructures are combined and named as 
“hybrid solar cell” (HSC). Organic materials absorb light as a donor and transport holes 
while inorganic materials act as an acceptor to transport electrons. The combination of 
organic and inorganic photoactive materials pr ovides some advantages over individual 
organic and inorganic solar cells. The overall cost  of the solar material is reduced by using 
organic thin film technology which is low co st, easy to manufacture and versatile while 
inorganic nanoparticles add high absorption coefficient and bandgap tenability [84].  
The idea of making hybrid solar cells has at tracted many researchers who then worked on 
different concepts of HSC manufacturing by  using bulk heterojunction concept with 
different nanoparticles such as TiO 2 [85], PbS [86-87], ZnO [88-89], CdS [90], CdSe [91-92], 
CdTe [93] and CuInS 2 [94]. Although HSCs provide some  advantages over inorganic solar 
cells, such as low cost, reduced thickness (being  thin film), easy manufacturing, versatility, 
tuneable nanoparticle size thus tuneable band gap etc., the power conversion efficiency of 
HSCs is still lower than that of silicon based inorganic solar cells. 
3.6. Brief history and recent developments on photovoltaic energy harvesting 
Since the discovery of photovoltaic effect by Becquerel, researchers have studied and 
worked on various photoactive materials and methods of making photovoltaic cells. The 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 278 
first solar cell was developed at Bell Laboratories [95], which was silicon based inorganic 
solar cell with power conversion efficiency of  6%. The hig hest reported power conversion 
efficiency for inorganic solar cells today is 24.7% [96]. 
Polymers including poly(sulphur nitride) an d polyacetylene were investigated for their 
photoelectric property in the 1980s. Using a donor and an acceptor material in a cell was a 
real breakthrough for organic photovoltaics. A donor - acceptor cell may consist of dye - 
dye, polymer - dye, polymer - polymer or polymer - fullerene blends [97]. Due to having 
high electron affinity, fullerenes have become the most widely used acceptor materials in 
organic solar cells and thus polymer - fullerene blends have received a particular interest 
from researchers. Photophysics of various conjugated polymer/C 60 blends have been 
extensively studied and reported [98-104]. 
MEH-PPV:C 60 a n d  M D M O - P P V : P C B M  w e r e  t h e  m o s t  p r edominant active layer materials. 
However, due to exhibiting large bandgap and low mobility of the PPV type polymers, 
efficiencies are limited to 3% [105-108]. Theref ore, researchers have started to work on 
different polymers and P3HT has become the most predominant active layer material for 
OPVs and also its blends with PCBM.  
Probably, the starting point of the rapid de velopments on P3HT:PCBM based OPVs was the 
work published in 2002 [109]. These researcher s investigated the short-circuit current 
density of P3HT:PCBM based organic solar cells with a weight ratio of 1:3 in active layer. 
They also recorded that it was the larg est short-circuit current density (8.7mAcm-2) observed 
in OPVs at that time.  
A number of studies have been carried out to increase the efficiency of P3HT:PCBM cells by 
thermal annealing [109-116]. It was found that the Voc was usually slightly decreased after 
annealing process while both the I sc a n d  F F  i n c r e a s e d  s i g n i f i c a n t l y  [ 1 1 7 ]  a n d  p r o v i d e s  
optimum charge carrier cr eation and extraction.  
The morphology and the optimization of the weight ratios for donor and acceptor are also 
important for a desirable performance. Stud ies showed that morphology of P3HT and 
PCBM can be modified upon [118-120]. Padinger  et al. [121] applied a post-treatment to 
P3HT:PCBM based solar cell by annealing and appl ying an external voltage greater than the 
open-circuit voltage, simultaneously. They repo rted that the post treatment increased all the 
parameters, such as I sc, V oc a n d  F F ,  t h u s  t h e  o v e r a l l  e f f i c i ency reached 3.5% from 0.4% 
(without any post treatment). 
There have been other approaches to control the morphology of P3HT:PCBM blends. It has 
been reported by Li et al. [122] that cont rolling the morphology of P3HT and PCBM in the 
blend is possible by slow drying. It has also been reported that additives, such as n-
hexylthiol, n-octylthiol, or n- dodecylthiol [123], can also co ntribute to the hole mobility 
enhancement slightly and charge-carrier life time significantly. Another approach to 
control the morphology was addition of ni trobenzene to P3HT:PCBM solution (in 
chlorobenzene) that increased the efficiency  a s  h i g h  a s  4 %  w i t h o u t  t h e r m a l  a n n e a l i n g  
[124-125].  
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 279 
The effect of weight ratio of P3HT and PCBM on the power conversion efficiency of OPVs 
has been extensively studied. Reports from va rious researchers confirmed each other’s work 
and the optimum weight ratio is considered  a s  1 : 1  [ 1 2 2 ,  1 2 6 - 1 2 9 ] .  T a b l e  2 - 4  s h o w s  t h e  
improvements in the efficien cies of P3HT:PCBM based organic photovoltaic materials. 
One of the most recent approaches is based on the growth of fibres by slow cooling of P3HT 
solutions [124]. The crystalline bres are isolated from the amorphous material by 
centrifugation and ltration and then reformulated  in dispersions with PCBM.  
The highest PCE reported recently is just th an 6% for OPV [130]. Researchers used a co-
polymer,poly[ N-9''-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiad 
iazole) (PCDTBT) as an electron donor materi al with the fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl 
C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 70BM) as an acceptor to fabricate a bulk heterojunction solar 
cell. They also investigated th at the internal quantum efficien cy was close to 100% so that 
essentially every absorbed photon resulted in a separated pair of charge carriers which were 
collected at the electrodes. Another group of re searchers have also reported development of 
a simple solar cell based on a mixture of fluorinated PTB4 and PC 61BM with higher than 6% 
power conversion efficiency [131]. The best lif e time recorded by Konarka is more than a 
year for polymer based PV [132]. 
3.7. Photovoltaic fibre attempts 
There are also a significant number of approa ches to produce solar cells in fibre form. 
However, Konarka Technologies, Inc. was th e first one who announced and patented the 
idea of producing a flexible photovoltaic fi bre via a continuous process in 2005 [133]. They 
have used an electrically conductive fi bre core which passes through a titania (TiO 2) 
suspension and thus coated with the interconnected nanoparticles. The interconnected 
nanoparticle coated fibre is dried and passed  through a dye solution and dried again. The 
dried fibre is then passed through a polyme ric electrolyte and thus coated with the 
transparent electrode.  
Kuraseko et al [134] reported flexible fibre-type  poly-Si solar cell. Glass fibre was used in the 
core of the fibre like photovoltaic structure and p-type poly-Si and n-type poly-Si was 
deposited onto the core. They studied two di fferent methods; atmospheric thermal CVC and 
microwave PECVD and the top (TCO) and botto m (metal) electrodes were deposited by 
thermal evaporation technique. There are also  m o r e  r e c e n t  w o r k s  o n  t h e  d e s i g n  o f  O P V  
based fibres [135-137] and DSSC based fibres [138-140].  
4. A new approach to energy harvesting by Hybrid Piezoelectric-
Photovoltaic (HPP) materials 
Renewable energy sources are endless but not available at all times at a given location. For 
instance, the electrical energy generation by a photovoltaic material is dependent on the 
light density and the number of photons absorb ed by the photoactive layer. If the solar 
radiation is scarce in a region, for example on a cloudy day, the electrical energy generation  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 280 
will be affected. If flexible solar cells are coup led with flexible piezoelectric materials in a 
combined structure, then the hybrid structur e can generate energy from solar radiation as 
well as mechanical energy, such as wind, rainfall, waves etc.  
A novel technology has been developed by Siores et al. [141] that integrates piezoelectric 
polymer substrate and photovoltaic coating system to create a film or a fibre structure 
(Figure 12) which is able to transform both mechanical energy (by using the piezoelectric 
part) and light energy (by using organic photovol taic part). Since the organic photovoltaic 
material system is made in a normal atmo spheric environment and the usage of ITO is 
eliminated, the cost associated with the whole structure is manifold less than silicon based 
photovoltaic. The resultant materi al system is flexible and can be incorporated in textiles for 
a wide variety of applications, under differe nt environments on earth, underwater and 
possibly space.  
 
Figure 12.  Sketch (a) and photograph (b) of hybrid fibre:  OPV cell layers developed onto Al evaporated 
piezoelectric fibre 
The HPP materials are able to produce electr ical energy from the en vironment and provide 
almost uninterrupted energy generation to powe r small electronic devices. The flexible HPP 
structure can be part of any material such as sail, window curtain, tent etc. to generate 
renewable energy even in the absence of sunlig ht. One possible configuration for land-based 
applications of hybrid fibre is a pine tree lik e structure where the needles are made of HPP 
fibres. Such a structure may replace the conven tional photovoltaic parks that require large 
panels and sun tracking devices to operate.  T h e  s u r f a c e  a r e a  t h a t  f i b r e s  p r o v i d e  i s  
substantially more compared to the solar panels , thus they may be able to generate more 
energy in a confined area. The tree structure al so costs less to manufacture and can harvest 
energy not only through the photovoltaic bu t also through the piezoelectric material. 
Furthermore, the aesthetic aspects of parks in corporating them cannot be overstated. Once 
flexible fibres are incorporated in textile structures, a plethora of opportunities exist, limited 
only by the imagination.  
Since the HPP structures produce combined piezoelectric technology which converts 
mechanical energy to fluctuating electrical en ergy (AC) and organic photovoltaic technology 
which converts solar energy to constant elec trical energy (DC), an associated rectifying 
circuit consisting of 4 diodes and a capacitor can be used to rectify the fluctuating voltage of 
 
Alternative Resources for Renewable Energy: Pi ezoelectric and Photovoltaic Smart Structures 281 
various frequencies to a constant DC voltage.  The constant voltage generated and rectified 
can then be either stored in an electrical  s t o r a g e  d e v i c e  s u c h  a s  b a t t e r i e s  a n d  s u p e r  
capacitors or can be utilised on-line directly. 
5. Conclusions 
The term “global warming” has been highlighted more and more every day since it is 
considered as one of the biggest dangers to life on  earth. It is a fact that one of the factors 
which cause global warming is high carb on emission. Growing population and the 
increasing technology consumerism contribute to the enhanced usage of energy from coal, 
oil, electricity etc. However, sooner or later th e mankind is anticipated to run out of the coal 
and oil reserves since they are finite and are not renewable. Energy harvesting properties of 
both piezoelectric and photovoltaic materials have been known for a long period of time 
however recently more attention has been pa id to produce usable materials for energy 
generation in the form of electricit y to decrease carbon foot print.  
Piezoelectric materials can convert almost any kind of mechanical energy to electrical 
energy. The most suitable piezoelectric material is chosen for a particular application 
depending on the properties needed. Thus , the maximum energy output, with minimum 
carbon emission, can be provided to power an electronic device on-line or to be stored. 
Photovoltaic materials use the biggest energy source to generate green energy and many 
countries, including Germany and Italy, are well aware of the advantages of using green 
energy. Furthermore, the incr easing solar cell production in general is considerably 
promising for a cleaner world. Hybrid photovoltaic and piezoelectric structures are capable 
of converting photons to electrical energy by using photovoltaic part and mechanical energy 
to electrical energy by using piezoelectric part, in the presence of rain, wind etc, where there 
is not enough sunlight for photo-conv ersion. The advantages of the hybrid 
photovoltaic/piezoelectric materials are their fl exibility, light weight, low production cost 
and the possibility of almost undisturbed energy generation from nature, such as sunlight, 
wind, rain and other mechanical resources. 
The smart materials discussed in this chapter ar e responsive to many natural resources for 
green energy generation. The increase in the us e of alternative resources for renewable energy 
can substantially decrease carbon  foot print and consequently the effects of global warming.

1. Introduction 
For a normal development of temperate zone frui t trees, a very complex phase of their life-
cycle called dormancy is regulated by environmental conditions during autumn-winter 
season. This phase allows those species to survive under adverse environmental conditions, 
and one of the most important factors whic h induce and release dormancy stage is 
temperature. It was adopted a terminology suggested by Lang et al. (1987 ) for the different 
stages of dormancy: para-, endo-, and ecodormancy.  
From the end of the 19th century, cultivation of  temperate zone fruit crops were set up in 
areas warmer than those traditionally cultivat ed. As the cultivars grown were those used 
traditionally, the chilling requirements were not adequately fulfilled. These difficulties led 
to identification and study problems of growin g temperate zone fruit crops in warm areas, 
which was approached in two different ways. On the one hand, traditional cultivars were 
selected and bred to obtain new cultivar s with commercial quality and low chilling 
requirement, which is a heritabl e character. On the other hand, new cultural practices, such 
as applications of rest-breaking agents, were  d e v e l o p e d  t o  a v o i d  o r  r e d u c e  t h e  n e g a t i v e  
consequences of an insufficient chilling accumu lation. The most useful option for temperate 
zone fruit crops in warm areas has frequently been a combination of low-chill cultivars and 
the adoption of cultural practices to break or  avoid dormancy. Although different species of 
the Rosaceae  family have been bred for low-chill cultivars, the furthest advances have been 
made in peaches and apples.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 292 
During dormancy, several events occur si multaneously, which modifies water and 
carbohydrate dynamics, hormonal balance, am ong others. Water is important for bud and 
plant development, such in solute translocatio n, enzymatic reactions, and osmotic regulated 
events, reason why many studies are focused on its dynamics. Recent studies in water 
dynamics during dormancy phase, such as the embolism (loss of hydraulic conductivity) in 
xylem of plants and water status (free or bo und water) in dormant buds determined by 
magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, showed the importance of water on dormancy release 
process. And under stressed conditions this importance seems to be strongly accentuated. 
1.1. Physiology of dormancy 
Dormancy is an adaptive behavior of temperat e zone tree species that allows the plant to 
survive under unfavorable conditions during wi nter. From the appearance of the bud only, 
it is difficult to ascertain what kind of biochemical and physiological changes are happening 
during this period ( Faust et al., 1997 ; Yooyongwech et al., 2008 a). 
Winter dormancy is an important adaptive me chanism for plant survival in temperate and 
cold climates. It is essential that the dormant co ndition is established within the plant well in 
advance of the cold season. This requires the timely sensing and physiological processing of 
a regular and reliable environmental signal ( Heide & Prestrud, 2005 ). 
Lang et al. (1987) classified the different ph ases of dormancy as ecodormancy, which is 
found in late winter and spring and imposed by unfavorable conditions to growth; 
paradormancy, which is equivalent to correlative inhibition or apical dominance; and 
endodormancy, also called deep or winter dorm ancy. The last is the genuine dormancy that 
characterizes woody plants in temperate zones and has been subject of many studies that 
have shown the enormous comple xity of this phenomenon.  
Lack of plant environmental synchrony is cons idered to be the primary cause of abiotic 
stress injury. Plant synchrony requires timely responses to environmental cues to minimize 
risk from abiotic stresses. The timing of gr owth cessation and dormancy, and subsequent 
cold acclimation, deacclimation and the depth of cold hardiness are all critical components 
of winter survival in temperate climates. Th e degree to which temperature mediates this 
response is important in order to determine th e impact of future temperature change in a 
global warming context on timing of growth ce ssation and cold acclim ation in woody plants 
(Tanino et al., 2010 ).  
In temperate zone deciduous fruit trees, the most important factor in dormancy release 
process is the accumulation of a certain amou nt of chilling (Lang, 1996). During dormancy, 
chilling temperature are associated with ch anges in carbohydrate contents and other 
substances, such as nucleic acids, proteins, polyamines, amino acids, organic acids and in 
the respiration rate, that might be related with bud break and the time of bloom ( Wang et 
al., 1987 ). 
Most of the temperature effects on plants  a r e  m e d i a t e d  b y  t h e i r  e f f e c t s  o n  p l a n t  
biochemistry. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the metabolic changes that Study on Temperate Zone Fruit Crops Under Warm Winter Conditions:  
A Special Focus on Water Dynamics During Dormancy Stage 293 
occurred during the period of dormancy release. Carbohydrate availability is presumably of 
major relevance to the control of bud growth and development during dormancy induction 
and its release ( Sherson et al., 2003 ), and might be related to the bud abortion ( Cottignies, 
1986 ). Starch, which is accumulated in reserve tissues during the preceding summer, is 
converted to sucrose and other soluble sugars during winter. Effects of chilling 
accumulation on changes in bo th starch and sugar concentrations may be explained because 
amylase activity is induced by  c o l d  t e m p e r a t u r e ,  w h i c h  r e s u l t  i n  i n c r e a s i n g  o f  s t a r c h  
hydrolysis and, consequent ly, sugar concentration ( Elle & Sauter, 2000 ).  
During winter, dynamics of carbohydrates in the different tissues reflects the inter-
conversion between starch and soluble sugars as described previously by Améglio et al. 
(2001), Lacointe et al. (1993 ), and Sauter (1980). Just before bud break, a strong increase in 
hexoses in apical buds seems closely linked to the decrease in su crose and starch. The 
sucrose decrease revealed high activity of  e n z y m e s  i n v o l v e d  i n  s u c r o s e  c a t a b o l i s m  
(Bonhomme et al., 2009). Starch, which is degrad ed by amylases, and is used to the sucrose 
synthesis by the sucrose-6-phosphate synthase (S PS) in response to decreasing temperature. 
The sucrose produced in reserve tissue is tran sported by the xylem pathway to the bud and 
hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose to supply energy and carbonic precursors ( Marafon et 
al., 2011 ; Yoshioka et al., 1988 ). 
Researchers have investigated the relati onships among carbohydrates (Fahmi, 1958; 
Monselise & Goldschmidt, 1981;  S a r m i e n t o  e t  a l . ,  1 9 7 6 ;  S t u t t e  &  M a r t i n ,  1 9 8 6 ) ,  h o r m o n e s  
(Chen, 1987; Lavee et al., 1983; Mullins & Rajasekaran, 1981; Ramirez & Hoad, 1981; Stephan 
et al., 1999), mineral nutrients (Golomp & Goldsc hmidt, 1981; Hartmann et al., 1966; Priestly, 
1977), and flower bud formation in  different fruit species.  
Ulger et al. (2004) observed that the abscisic  a c i d  ( A B A ) ,  i n d o l e - 3 - a c e t i c  a c i d  ( I A A ) ,  a n d  
gibberellic acid (GA 4) levels in leaves, nodes and fruits of olive ( Olea europea  L.) during the 
induction, initiation, and differentiation periods in the on year were lower than those in the 
off year. Similarly, Pal & Ram (1978) in mango ( Mangifera indica  L . ) ,  U l g e r  e t  a l .  ( 1 9 9 9 )  i n  
olive, and Chen (1990) in litchi ( Litchi chinensis  Sonn.), demonstrated higher GA 3 level in the 
on year. The fact that GA 3 decreased and GA 4 l e v e l s  i n c r e a s e d  d u r i n g  t h e  i n d u c t i o n  a n d  
initiation periods in the off year suggest that they affect flower bud formation. Looney et al. 
(1985 ) determined that exogenous GA 4 application on apple ( Malus domestica  Borkh.) tr ees 
promoted flowering and yield, and Stephan et al. (1999 ) also noted that lack of GA 4 induced 
a biennial bearing habit. 
An increase in zeatin levels during the indu ction period in the off year suggests that had 
possibly a positive effect on floral formation (Chen, 1987, 1990; Mullin s & Rajasekaran, 1981; 
Ramirez & Hoad, 1981; Ulger et al., 2004 ). Many experiments confirmed the direct 
involvement of different growth regulators in promoting or inhibiting flower bud induction 
and differentiation. However, all these studies were related to the effect of a single regulator 
or its quantitative changes before, during or  after flower bud induction (Lavee, 1989). On 
contrary to plant growth regulators, Ulger et al. (2004 ) suggested that carbohydrates and 
mineral nutrients might not have a direct effect to induce flower initiation.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 294 
1.2. Global warming and dormancy 
Global climate change can alter signific antly plant phenology because temperature 
influences the timing of development, both al one and through interactions with other cues, 
such as photoperiod (Bernier, 1988; Partanen et al., 1998). Temp erature records showed that, 
over the past 30 years, global averag e surface temperatures increased by 0.28oC per decade 
(Cleland et al., 2007). 
Fruit and vegetable growth and development are influenced by different environmental 
factors. Studies conducted by Moretti et al. ( 2012) showed that warmer temperatures affect 
photosynthesis directly, causing alterations in  carbohydrates, organic acids, and flavonoid 
contents, firmness and antioxidant activities ; carbon dioxide (CO 2) accumulation in the 
atmosphere had direct effects on postharvest quality causing tuber malformation, 
occurrence of common scab, and changes in reducing sugars contents on potatoes; high 
concentrations of atmospheric ozone can potentially caused reduction in the photosynthetic 
process, growth, and biomass accumulation. Understanding how climate changes will 
impact fruit crop production in the next decades is extremely important for survival.  
All economically important fruit and nut tree species that originated from temperate and 
cold subtropical regions have chilling requirements that need to be fulfilled each winter to 
ensure homogeneous flowering and fruit set, and generate economically sufficient yields 
(Luedeling et al., 2009). Elevated concentration of atmospheric CO 2, warmer temperatures in 
general, and changing precipitation regimes will affect the exchange of energy, carbon, 
water and nutrients between forests and the en vironment, leading to changes in forest 
growth, survival and structure. Interactions with biotic and abiotic disturbance agents will 
also shape future forests (Chmura et al., 2011).  
Lack of chilling, associated with mild winter conditions, results in abnormal patterns of bud 
break and development in temperate zone frui t trees (Mauget & Rageau, 1988) and is known 
as the main factor of pear flower bud abortion  in Brazil ( Petri et al., 200 2; Petri & Hert er, 
2002) and New Zealand (Do Oh & Klinac, 2003; Klinac & Geddes, 1995 ). Rakngan et al. 
(1996 ) observed that the Japanese pear trees under enough chilling released from dormancy 
earlier than plants with insu fficient chilling accumulation. The occurrence of intermittent 
warm days during dormancy period, with te mperatures higher than 27 C, delayed the 
dormancy release more than mild te mperature fluctuations (2-3 C) ( Marafon et al., 2011 ). 
1.3. Apple and pear production under warm winter conditions of Brazil 
Apple orchards in Brazil has been highlighted by growth in harvested area of 34%, 30% in 
production, 948% in exported quantity and 1328%  in exportation value in the last 10 years. 
These results reinforce the trend that has been  happening since the beginning of pomiculture 
in the country and reveal the great exportation potential of Brazil. The responsible factors for 
this great development of the apple orchards is  due to the development of technologies used 
in crops, the logistics in place, the definition  of cultivars (Gala 58% and Fuji 36%) and clones 
capable to meet consumer demands (Fachinello et al., 2011). Study on Temperate Zone Fruit Crops Under Warm Winter Conditions:  
A Special Focus on Water Dynamics During Dormancy Stage 295 
In addition to government incentives to a pple crop on 1970’s decade, which resulted in 
improvement of plant breeding, nutrition an d phytotechnical management, post-harvest 
technology, made by research centers and exte nsion programs, enabled to change from an 
importer country to export in a few years. One decade  after starting  the apple crop 
production  on a commercial scale , Brazilian  a p p l e  i m p o r t a t i o n s  began  to decline,  and 
actually is considered  self-sufficient  (Boneti et al., 2002; Fachinello et al., 2011). 
On contrary, pear crop production is not cons idered a fruit of great expression despite the 
large domestic market for pear fruit, moreover, it has the lowest expression in terms of 
production, crop area and production value (Fioravanço, 2007). In the beginning of 1960’s 
decade, the pear crop in Brazil was economica lly more important than apple. According to 
FAOSTAT (2012), in 1961, the harvested area, prod uction, and yield of pear crop were 70%, 
22%, and 34% higher than apple, but in 2010 it  was 25 times, 78 times, and 3 times lower, 
respectively. Such situation was changed at th e end of 1970’s, and nowadays Brazil imports 
around 90% of fresh pear fruit (140,000 tone s), corresponding to USD 130 million in 2009.  
It is therefore possible to note that pear crop  r e p r e s e n t s  a n  i m p o r t a n t  m a r k e t  o p p o r t u n i t y .  
Isolated initiatives of pear (European and Japanese cultivars) crop in highlands of Southern 
Brazil have confirmed the viability of its commercial  production. A great demand of this fruit in 
local market occurs in Brazil, but it is observed a technological lack available for growers, such 
as development of cultivars of both rootstock an d scion adapted to mild winter conditions, crop 
management adapted to such environmental cond itions, appropriate logi stic systems, among 
other factors (Faoro, 2001). Low rates of fruit set (Petri, 2008) and high incidence of 
physiological disorder called locally “flower bud abortion” (Marafon et al., 2011; Petri & Herter, 
2002; Petri et al., 2001; Trevisan et al., 2005) are cited as factors of low yield in pear crops. In mild 
winter conditions of Southern Brazil, over 60% of “flower bud abortion” was found in 2001 
(Petri et al., 2002) and more than 90% in 1999, resulting in low numbers of opened flowers at the 
bud break and consequently low production (Veríssimo et al., 2002). Another consequence of 
low chilling accumulation during dormancy st age is a prolonged and poorly synchronized 
flowering, which results in poor uniformity of fruit size at harvest (Yamamoto, 2010). 
Nishimoto et al. (1995) cited the value of 750 chilling hours as the re quirement in ‘Housui’ 
buds, but the amount of 600 hours below 7.2oC (80% of requirement) brought about the 
release from endodormancy st age (Yamamoto et al., 2010a). According to Yamamoto (2010), 
however, abnormalities on floral primordia (partial or total necrosis) and eventual 
development of new inflorescenc es, during dormancy progression  (Fig. 1) and at flowering, 
were observed in all treatments in lateral bu ds of Japanese pear shoots (Fig. 2). These 
symptoms became severe with prolonged cold  deprivation before chilling accumulation 
(simulation of delayed mild winter, treatment 3) and after consecutive seasons (simulation 
of permanent global warming situat ion) (Yamamoto et al., 2010a, b). 
2. Past works carried out in wate r dynamics by using magnetic resonance 
techniques 
Water is one of the basic determining factors of  bud development because it is quantitatively 
the major component of plant tissues. Besides, it is the essential medium for many metabolic  
Global Warming – Impacts and Future Perspective 296 
processes, such as transpiration, CO 2 u p t a k e ,  a n d  p h o t o s y n t h e s i s ,  w h i c h  r e g u l a t e s  p l a n t  
production, yield, and reprod uction. Dormancy, an importan t phase which allow temperate 
zone fruit crops to overwinter, is considered to be closely related to changes in water 
movement ( Welling & Palva, 2006 ). 
Winter temperatures can impair the hydraulic functions of trees because water uptake from 
soil water reservoirs is very li mited when upper soil layers are cool or frozen during winter 
months or early spring (Mellander et al., 2006; Peguero-Pina et al., 2011).

2.1. Hydraulic conductivity in plants  
In temperate zone woody plants, hydraulic co nductivity describes resistance of xylem 
against embolism formation (Mayr et al., 2003)  a n d  c a n  b e  i m p a i r e d  b y  x y l e m  e m b o l i s m ,  
which is mainly caused by water stress or fros t (Cochard et al., 2001; Cochard & Tyree, 1990; 
Sperry & Sullivan, 1992). Frost-induced embolism can occur as a consequence of alternating 
Study on Temperate Zone Fruit Crops Under Warm Winter Conditions:  
A Special Focus on Water Dynamics During Dormancy Stage 297 
frost–thaw events (Améglio et al., 1995; Cochard & Tyree, 1990; Just & Sauter, 1991; 
Pockman & Sperry, 1997). As the sap freezes, prev iously dissolved gases escape because of 
their low solubility in ice (Sperry & Sullivan,  1992). On subsequent thawing, these bubbles 
can either dissolve back into the xylem sap or grow to obstruct the entire xylem conduit 
(Cruiziat et al., 2002, 2003; Yang & Tyree, 1992), resulting in an embolized conduit that is 
unable to transport water (Améglio et al., 2002).  
 
Figure 2.  Average number of opened flowers per bud, from 2005-2006 to 2008-2009 seasons in 
treatments 1 (normal chilling treatment), 2 (one month of cold deprivation before exposure to chill), 3 
(two months of cold deprivation), and natural conditio ns (NC). The vertical bars are mean ± SD (n = 10) 
(Yamamoto, 2010). 
It was demonstrated loss of hydraulic conductivity in xylem vessels during winter on peach 
trees conditioned to temperatures between 4-19 C after several cycles of freeze-thaw 
(Améglio et al., 2002). In deci duous fruit species, an increa se in sap tension caused by 
dehydration of the tissue can a ffect the resumption of growth  and production, moreover, in 
the xylem pathway between buds and twigs, a ffecting translocation of nutrients to the 
developing bud (Lauri & Cochard, 2008). 
2.2. Water status determined by MRI techniques in buds during dormancy 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) possibly the determination of water properties in 
biological systems by measurin g proton spin density and relaxation time by spectroscopy 
(Chudek & Hunter, 1997). Magnetic resonance imag ing (MRI) technique, a spatially resolved 
NMR in essence, is cited as an important tool for providing detailed and quantitative 
information on both water transport and status in intact plants (Van As et al., 2009). In 
addition, it is a non-destructive technique, allowing a continuous developmental analysis 
that provides morphological and molecular structure information, measurements of 
biophysical parameters, including diffusion, viscosit y, and solute status (Van As et al., 2009; 
Van der Toorn et al., 2000).  
The long-distance transport of water (sap) pl ays an important and crucial role in the 
exchange of nutrients and plan t hormones between different organs. MR techniques have 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 298 
been used to study the sap flow in xylem (Jo hnson et al., 1987; Köcken berger et al., 1997; 
Scheenen et al., 2007; Van As, 2007; Wistuba et al., 2000) as well as in its embolism 
occurrence (Clearwater & Clark, 2003; Fukuda  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 7 ;  H o l b r o o k  e t  a l . ,  2 0 0 1 ;  
Umebayashi et al., 2011; Utsuzawa et al., 2005). In  contrast to MRI, images obtained by 
synchrotron X-ray has higher spatial resolution, with possibility to obtain in real time. Such 
technique was used to study the mechanism of water-refilling of embolized xylem vessels, 
and provided a dynamic data on water transp ort (Lee & Kim, 2008). Brodersen et al. (2010) 
presented the in vivo 3D visualization and quan tification of the vessel refilling process in 
grapevine ( Vitis vinifera ) by using a high-resolution X-ray computed tomography. 
Portable MRI systems were developed recently (R okitta et al., 2000; Van As et al., 1994), but 
limitations on magnetic field or MRI probes, equipments weight, exte rnal electromagnetic 
noise, temperature drift, among others, were ci ted. Umebayashi et al. (2011) monitored the 
developmental process of xylem embolism in Pine wilt disease by using a compact magnetic 
resonance imaging system with a U-shaped prob e coil. Kimura et al. (2011) adapted a probe 
with a local electromagnetic shielding, and a fl exible rotation and translation mechanism in 
an electric wagon system. Thes e authors did a whole-day outd oor MRI measurements in not 
detached Japanese pear shoots, and a correlation between water flow and solar radiation 
were observed. Fukuda et al. (2007) found th at cavitation and embolism events in water-
stressed Japanese black pine ( Pinus thunbergii  P a r l . )  s e e d l i n g s  w e r e  d e t e c t e d  b y  a c o u s t i c  
emission coupled with magnetic resonance microscopy, respectively.  
NMR and MRI has been used to provide details during cold acclimatization and/or 
dormancy stage control in organs and tissues of several species, such as in dogwoods (Burke 
et al., 1974), Norway spruces (de Fay et al., 2000), tulip bulbs (Kamenetsky et al., 2003; Van 
der Toorn et al., 2000b), hybrid poplars (Kalcsits et al., 2009), blueberries (Parmentier et al., 
1998; Rowland et al., 1992), grapes (Fennell & Li ne, 2001; Gardea et al., 1994), peaches (Erez 
et al., 1998; Sugiura et al., 1995; Yooyongwech et  al., 2008b), Japanese pears (Yamamoto et al., 
2010a), apples (Faust et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1993; Millard et al., 1993;  Snaar & Van As, 1992), 
among others. 
Differences in MRI signal strength between en do- and ecodormant buds is attributed to 
water content and its mobility (Faust et al., 1991). MRI prim arily detects differences in 
proton relaxation time of water, spin-lattice or longitudinal T 1, and spin-spin or transverse T 2. 
A short relaxation time is interpreted as an indicator of water associated or bounded to 
macromolecules and a longer relaxation time is  indicative of freer water (Parmentier et al., 
1998).  
A mobility restricted form or bounded water become freer with progression of 
endodormancy or chillin g accumulation in apple (Faust et al., 1991) and blueberry buds 
(Rowland et al., 1992), among other fruit spec ies. At endodormancy stage, freer water 
appeared but as a slower response to forcing conditions, indicating that changes on water 
status is more correlated to growth resumption  in peach buds (Erez et al., 1998). Apple buds 
in terminal portions of shoot had both higher  water content and proportionally more free 
water that did buds in the lower portions, which demonstrate a gradient in dormancy (or Study on Temperate Zone Fruit Crops Under Warm Winter Conditions:  
A Special Focus on Water Dynamics During Dormancy Stage 299 
resumption of growth ability) along the shoot  ( L i u  e t  a l . ,  1 9 9 3 ) .  T h e  r e l a x a t i o n  t i m e  
measured in flower buds is an indicator of the physiological development of ecodormancy 
because of water absorption (Sugiura et al ., 1995). Peach cultivars with lower chilling 
requirement increased both T 2 a n d  P D  a f t e r  r e l e a s e  o f  d o rmancy, which occurred earlier 
compared to high-chill cultivars (Yooyongwech et al., 2008b). Water transport in twigs of 
Picea  was firstly slow during winter season and th en increased relatively fast in early spring 
(de Fay et al., 2000).  
In addition to these two parameters, apparent co efficient of self-diffusion (ADC) behavior of 
molecules can also contribute to the image contrast (Chen et al., 1978), by providing 
information on water diffusion at the cellular or tissue level (de Fay et al., 2000). Proton 
density (PD) predominantly represents water molecular mobility at cellular level and water 
membrane permeability (Van der Toorn et al., 2000). 
Under water deficit conditions, membrane permeability seems to have two opposite actions: 
increase permeability to facilitate water transp ort to maintain cell expansion and rehydration 
of tissues, or induces a decrease permeability to  p r e s e r v e  c e l l u l a r  w a t e r  w i t h i n  t h e  t i s s u e s  
(Barrieu et al., 1999; Smart et al., 2001; Va n der Weerd et al., 2002). The discovery of 
aquaporins in the beginning of 1990’s popularize d the concept of membrane water channels 
(Connolly et al., 1998; Engel et al., 2000; Presto n & Agre, 1991), and their roles were studied 
on membrane permeability (Johansson et al., 2000; Maurel, 2007; Sakr et al., 2003; Sarda et al., 
1999; Van der Weerd et al., 2002). The most immediate decrease in ADC under dormancy 
inducing conditions occurred in the axillary buds of poplar followed by the vascular bud 
trace region (de Fay et al., 2000). Yooyongwech et al. (2008), by comparing two cultivars of 
peaches, found increase of such proteins in  bud portions after the endodormancy release 
irrespective of their chilling requirements. From  the same experiment, they suggested that an 
increase in ADC can be used as a indica tor of ecodormancy release in peach buds. 
de Fay et al. (2000) used diffusion-weighted  i m a g e s  t o  d e m o n s t r a t e  w a t e r  m o v e m e n t  a n d  
activity during budburst of spruce ( Picea abies  ( L . )  K a r s t . )  a f t e r  f u l f i l l m e n t  o f  c h i l l i n g  
requirement. Similar methodology was used by  Van der Toorn et al. (2000) to assess water 
mobility, which is proportional to ADC value. Past investigations had been limited by low 
resolution of the images, but recently th e ADC measurements correlated better with 
dormancy development than di d the vascular tissue measurem ents (Kalcsits et al., 2009). 
3. Present work: Determination of water status by MRI in flower buds 
under mild winter conditions 
The following experiment was conducted in order to verify the effect of delayed mild winter 
conditions and consecutive seasons on water dynamics by using the MRI techniques, and to 
analyze a possible correlation wi th floral primordia necrosis. 
Plants of Japanese pear ( Pyrus pyrifolia  (Burm. f.) Nakai) var. culta ‘Housui’ grafted on P. 
pyrifolia  v a r .  pyrifolia  (‘Yamanashi’) rootstock were obtained from a commercial nursery, 
transplanted into a 30 cm diameter plastic po ts in April 2005 and grown at the Agricultural  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 300 
and Forestry Research Centre, University of Tsukuba, Japan (36o2’ N, 140o4’ E, 25 m above 
sea level). One-year old shoots were reoriented  to horizontal position in order to promote 
flower bud formation (Ito et al., 1999).  
Plants were divided into three groups, in order to simulate different conditions of chilling 
accumulation: plants were kept under natu ral conditions, with chilling accumulation 
superior that than required for this cultivar (NC); two groups of plants were submitted to 
two months (November and December) of cold deprivation in a heat ed greenhouse before 
exposure to chilling amount of 600 hours below 7.2oC (CH), in order to simulate a delayed 
mild winter condition of subtropical climates. These two groups of plants were exposure to 
such conditions for either a single season  o f  2 0 0 8 - 2 0 0 9  ( t r e a t m e n t  S S )  a n d  d u r i n g  f o u r  
consecutive seasons, from 2005-2006 until 2008- 2009 (treatment CS). The later condition was 
set as a tentative to simulate conditions  o f  p e r m a n e n t  w a r m  w i n t e r .  A f t e r  c h i l l i n g  
accumulation, plants were again moved to a heated greenhouse, with minimum 
temperature set at 16oC, to force bud break (Fig. 3). 
 
Figure 3.  Experimental design for MRI measurements, from November (N) to March (M). Plants were 
kept under natural conditions (NC) and cold deprivation during two months before exposure to 600 
hours of chilling accumulation below 7.2oC under two regimes: a single season of 2008-2009 (SS), and 
four consecutive seasons from 2005-2006 to 2008-2009 (CS) (Yamamoto et al., 2010a). 
Both field and greenhouse air temperature was recorded by a data logger (TR-51A, T and D 
Co., Matsumoto, Japan). Chilling calculation started when two consecutive hours below 
7.2oC were detected in field. In the heated  g r e e n h o u s e ,  m a x i m u m  t e m p e r a t u r e  w a s  n o t  
controlled and plants were submitted do natural photoperiod. 
All MRI measurements were made in 2008-2009 se ason. Three lateral buds were collected 
randomly from one-year old shoots. Samples we re taken from SS and CS after one month of 
cold deprivation (CD1), at the end of cold de privation and just before the chilling treatment 
(0 CH, SS only), at the end of chilling tr eatment (600 CH), and before bud break under 
forced conditions (4000 GDH). Under NC, samples were taken in the middle of 
endodormancy (December), duri ng transition from endo- to  ecodormancy (January), middle 
(February) and end of ec odormancy stage (March). ND J F M ND J F M ND J F M N D J F MCSSSNC

MRI measurements were performed using an NMR spectrometer (DRX 300WB, Bruker, 
Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a microimaging accessory at a magnetic field of 7.1 
Tesla at ƿ21°C (Fig. 4A). Magnetic resonance images  were acquired and reconstructed with 
ParaVision imaging software (ver. 3.0.2 Bruk er). The sample was placed on a homemade 
plastic holder and putted in a 15 mm NMR coil  ( F i g .  4 B ) .  M o r p h o l o g i c a l  i m a g e s  a n d  3 2  
sequential echo images in longitudinal sections of flower buds were obtained by a multi-
slice multi-echo MRI pulse program. For morpho logical images the repetition time was set 
to 1 s with the echo time of 5.524 ms, the matrix size of 256 × 256, the field of view of 15 × 15 
mm2 or  18 ×  1 5 m m2, and the slice thickness of 0.5 mm. The sequential echo images were 
obtained with the repletion time of 5 s, the echo time of 3.069 to 115.5 ms with a constant 
interval of 3.069 ms, the matrix size of 128 × 128, and same field of view and slice thickness 
with morphological images. T 2 (spin-spin relaxation time) and relative proton density (PD) 
maps were calculated from 32 sequential images using the image sequential tool in 
ParaVision. Three regions of in terest (ROIs) of grouped flor al primordia, bud base, and 
whole bud were determined manually in a longitudinal section at the highest bud base 
portion of flower bud (Fig. 4C) and T 2 values of each ROI was also calculated. There were 
three replications of each analysis.

Under warm and delayed winter conditions (SS and CS), however, T 2 v a l u e s  o f  f l o r a l  
primordia increased only afte r the end of chilling accumula tion (600 CH to 4000 GDH). The

accumulation, but under SS were lower than th ose of NC until after submitting plants to

buds showed constant T 2 v a l u e s  u n t i l  s u b m i t t i n g  p l a n t s  t o  h e a t i n g  a c c u m u l a t i o n ,  w h e n

under NC, whereas treated plants (SS and CS) had low values at the end of the chilling 
treatment (600 CH) (Fig. 5C). 
T2 and proton density (PD) maps (Fig. 6) were almost entirely calculated in detected parts of 
the morphological images (Fig. 7). Water mobility, as determined by T 2 (Fig. 6A), showed 
intermediate values (16 to 24 ms) in the floral  primordia, bud base, and bud scales of plants 
kept under fulfillment of chilling requirement (NC) on March. In contrast, at the end of 
chilling treatment (600 CH), buds of plants ke pt just a single season under warm winter 
conditions (SS) showed high T 2 values (over than 24 ms) in the lower portions of the bud 
scales, while values were similar to NC in the bud base. Compared to SS and NC, T 2 values 
increased (to higher than 16 ms) after several se asons of mild and delayed winter conditions 
(CS) before flowering only in specific portio ns of bud base and scales near the bud base.

heating accumulation (4000 GDH), PD was higher  in primordia and some specific portions 
of bud base after consecutive seasons of mild winter conditions (CS).  
Structural changes during dormancy until fl owering were observed in morphological MR 
images of longitudinal sections at the central portion of ‘Housui’ flower buds (Fig. 7). Plants 
grown under normal conditions of  winter (NC) had a single inflorescence, with a high and 
uniform signal intensity of bud scales and fl oral primordia during all dormancy stage. 
However, bud scales and floral primordia conf igurations were remark ably different under 
mild winter conditions. Signals from upper portion of bud scales could not be detected at 
the end of cold deprivation (0 CH). Signals in  floral primordia were not uniform from the 
end of chilling accumulation, and numbers of detected primordia and inflorescences were 
different. After four consecutive seasons of mild winters (CS), buds showed also variations 
on primordia size especially during he ating accumulation (600 CH and 4000 GDH).

Morphological comparison between buds of plants growing under natural (NC) and warm 
winter conditions for several seasons (CS) is showed in Fig. 8. Externally there was no 
morphological differences between then in ph otographs obtained from digital microscope 
(Figs. 8A, D), but under NC both floral prim ordia and bud scales remained green (Fig. 8B), 
whereas necrosed primordia was observed unde r CS (Fig. 8E). MR images showed such 
differences (Figs. 8C, F). Differences on coloration of bud scales between bud of plants 
grown under natural and warm winters could be  o b s e r v e d  a l s o  i n  p h o t o g r a p h s  o b t a i n e d

During November, there were no morphologica l differences observed in SEM images, but 
during cold deprivation (December), buds of pl ants grown under mild winter conditions (SS 
and CS) developed a second inflorescence (F ig. 10). Digital photographs obtained in 
February (after chilling treatment) showed a progression of floral primordia necrosis and 
development of new inflorescences in different  levels. Reduced number of opened flowers, 
variations on length of pedicels, and differenc es on flowering stage were observed in buds 
of plants grown under m ild winter conditions.

3.2. Discussion 
The data presented suggest that MRI techniques can be an useful non-destructive and rapid 
analysis tool of internal anatomical details of  tissues or organs, the spatial distribution of 
water, dynamics and mobility of water (Yamamoto et al., 2010a). Japanese pear plants 
grown under conditions of sufficient chilling a ccumulation showed a gradual increase in T 2 
values in the whole bud, indicating a conversion from bound to free water (Fig. 6A). In other 
words, the endodormancy stage takes place to the ecodormant phase, which is correlated to 
free water (Faust et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1993;  Sugiura et al., 1995). However, plants grown 
under mild and delayed winter conditions kept high levels of bound water (low T 2 values) 
in the floral primordia, bud base, and whole bu d until the end of chilling treatment, and an 
abrupt change to free-state water during th e afterward heating accumulation period was 
observed. Previous studies in peaches suggested a correlation between the level of bound 
water and cold hardiness (Erez et al., 1998; Faus t, 1991; Parmentier et al., 1998) through the 
activation of dehydrin, a hydr ophilic protein (Kalberer et al ., 2006; Rowland & Arora, 1997; 
Yamane et al., 2006). Differences in T 2 values  at the end of chilling accumulation (600 CH) is

probably resulted from reduction on percenta ge of normal primordia occurred during cold 
deprivation in buds grown under mild winter conditions (data not shown). Differences in T 2 
signal intensity with time, as a consequence of environmental temperature variation, were 
detected in buds of plants grown for only one season under mild winter conditions, whereas 
response under several seasons tended to occur slowly and was specific to some portion of 
the bud, like in the dupl icated inflorescence. 
The proton density (PD), which is also called spin density, indicates the concentration of 
MRI-visible protons, which were associated with water protons (Brown et al., 1986). PD 
maps (Fig. 6B) showed a low water content in the bud scales under mild winter conditions, 
and a high water content in specific portions of the floral primordia (600 CH) and bud base 
(4000 GDH) in bud after continuous mild winter  seasons. A possible loss of functionality in 
vascular connections or dysfunction of water channel proteins between bud base and 
primordia under mild winter conditions might be  resulted in progression  of floral primordia 
necrosis (Yamamoto et al. 2010a). This irregula r distribution of water resulted in a high 
water mobility in morphologically modified portions of the bud. However, it was not 
possible to determine the cause and effect essay. 
The highest incidence of flower bud abortion in  Japanese pear under m ild winter conditions 
was observed in lateral buds of young shoot s (Klinac & Geddes, 1995), reason why this bud 
type was used in this experiment. It was demonstrated that lateral (axillary) buds have the 
greatest sensitivity to temperature-induced do rmancy (Kalcsits et al., 2009). Bud scales, 
which are modified leaves responsible for enclos ing and protecting buds  of perennial plants, 
had high T 2 and PD values in the buds of plants grown under sufficient chilling conditions, 
during all dormancy stages of our experime nt. In contrast, the low water mobility (T 2) and 
low water content (PD) detected by MRI and in the scales of buds exposed to mild and 
delayed winter conditions might have been related to an increase on sensibility of the floral 
primordia to external temperature oscillation s and/or reduced protection from freezing 
during winter (Yamamoto et al., 2010a). 
Changes of amplitude on NMR signal intensity is  related to the number of protons, and is 
proportional to the water content per volume element (voxel) (Donker et al., 1997; Van der 
Weerd et al., 2002). Morphological images of lo ngitudinal sections showed different signal 
intensities in buds of plants kept under delayed and warm winter conditions. Photographs 
and morphological images of buds showed a clear difference in conditions of these bud 
scales (Figs. 7, 8, 9). Yooyongwech et al. (2008b) reported that oscillation temperature 
conditions accelerate water movement in peach buds, but promoted an irregular bud 
growth. The effect of consecutive seasons of mild  winter (CS) on reduction of water mobility 
and content in bud scales was also observed by a more accentuated reduction on signal 
intensity (Yamamoto et al., 2010a). An important de tail in MR studies is that only detectable 
portions are used. Dehydrated bud scales or necrosed floral primordia, and also structures 
located in different plans from selected section is not considered. 
Buds under normal winter conditions had all of  floral primordia developed normally, only a 
single inflorescence was observed during th e dormant period, and all primordia sprouted 
simultaneously (Figs. 9, 10). Ho wever, plants grown under mild  winter conditions developed 
a second (sometimes a third) inflorescence in bu ds of Japanese pear, resulting in more than 8

floral primordia per bud in aver age (data not shown). In such ar tificial conditions of 80% of 
chilling fulfillment, a prolonged flowering period , with low number of opened flowers was 
observed, regarding of necrosis incidence in flor al primordia. It was possible to reproduce, in 
this experiment, similar phenology observed in a warm winter conditions of Southern Brazil 
and described by several authors as “flower bud abortion” (Marafon et al., 2011; Petri & 
Herter, 2002; Petri et al., 2002; Petri et al., 2001;  Trevisan et al., 2005; Veríssimo et al., 2002).  
4. Conclusions and future prospects 
A cumulative effect of several seasons of mild  winter conditions could be observed, wh ere 
flower primordia necrosis occurrence were anti cipated with delaying chilling accumulation. 
Moreover, a dehydration of bud scales, development of new inflorescences, different degrees 
of necrosis, and development of abnormal flow ers were observed. MR images indicated that 
low levels of mobile water (T 2) and relative water content (PD) in bud scales might affect the 
sensibility of flower primordia to external temperature oscillations under mild winter 
conditions. Another possible consequence of su ch changes on water dynamics is a reduction 
on protection from freezing temperatures (harde ning level) during winter. Floral primordia 
necrosis might reallocate water, by affecting its absorption potential, and other functional 
elements (carbohydrates or plant hormones) for development of new inflorescences.  
Studies on hydraulic conductivity are focused on situations of severe winters, generally 
observed in the Northern hemisphere, where sa p freezing occurs in xylem. But, how is the 
functioning of winter embolism in deciduous w oody plants in regions where winter is more 
affected by global warming? 
The advanced measurement techniques above ment ioned, which can facilitate investigations 
of water movement in intact plants, seems to be a promising methodology to study in long-
distance water transport and water dynamics in  s p e c i f i c  p o r t i o n s  o f  p l a n t  t i s s u e s  g r o w n  
under conditions of global warming context. Un fortunately, major part of these studies were 
done in a typical temperate zones (Germany, Japan, Netherlands, USA, among others), 
where just recently faced the effect of global climate changes. In subtropical climates of 
Southern Brazil, for example, temperate zone  f r u i t  c r o p s  w e r e  p r o d u c e d  u n d e r  m a r g i n a l  
conditions of mild winters. Actually, in such  locations basically phenotypical observations 
and superficial determinations of water or carb ohydrate contents were done experimentally. 
So, a lack of more specific studies, by usin g modern techniques described in this chapter 
under "natural" marginal conditions during dormancy phase, is nowadays observed. A 
multidisciplinary approach, including multi-in stitutional collaborations and international 
cooperation, is needed to study the conseq uences of global warming on water dynamics 
during dormancy phase in temperate zone  fruit crops with economic importance.

1. Introduction 
Nitrogen, in a similar way to carbon, has a co mplex and fragile global cycle. Anthropogenic 
activities from the beginning of the 20th c e n t u r y  h a v e  i n t e r f e r e d  w i t h  t h i s  f i n e  n i t r o g e n -
balance by capturing N 2 from the atmosphere for fertiliser  production. When stable N from 
the atmosphere enters the forage crop producti on and stock-raising cycle it returns to the 
environment as waste and in  more reactive forms.  
During the combustion of energy crops the fu el-bound N forms greenhouse gases which are 
liberated to the atmosphere, therefore both fe rtiliser applications and biomass combustion 
can be directly linked to nitrogen related environmental problems. 
Short-rotation plantations irrigated with efflue nt have both high nitrogen uptake capacity 
[1] and also enhance growth characteristi cs without the application of fertilisers or 
competition with fresh water usage [2, 3]. Furthermore wastewater irrigation1 r e d u c e s  t h e 
cost of wastewater treatment while crops cultiv ated on the land can provide solution for the 
increasing energy demand of rural areas wi thout destroying existing forestry [2]. 
In order to choose appropriate feedstock an d design a biomass-to-energy conversion 
technology both the economical and environmenta l aspect of a project should be considered. 
Biomass pyrolysis, which is the thermal degrad ation of the biomass in an inert atmosphere, 
provides an advanced liquid fuel. Pyrolysis liq uid (or bio-oil) is the subject of intense 
research and investigations for direct energy applications to provide green electric power 
with highest efficiency [4].

wastewater. Wastewater irrigation  can refer to both flood irrigation, spray irrigation, subsurface drains and other applications.  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 318 
This chapter introduces the use of energy crops into the global nitrogen-cycle by following 
nitrogen from wastewater irrigation via ener gy conversion (biomass pyrolysis) and finally 
back to soil in a stable form to close the circle (Fig. 1).

2. Wastewater and wastewater treatments 
2.1. Nitrogen in municipal wastewater  
Nitrogen in domestic wastewater is present in  b o t h  i n o r g a n i c  a n d  o r g a n i c  f o r m s .  O r g a n i c  
nitrogen from human diet and metabolism is transformed into free ammonia (NH 3) and 
ammonium cation (NH 4+) by microorganism [5, 6] The NH 3 to NH 4+ ratio in water is depending 
on temperature and pH. The presence of free NH 3 above the concentration of 0.002 mg/L is toxic 
for the ecosystem [7]. Ammonia is also the source of inorganic nitrate and nitrite (NO 3-, NO 2-) 
nitrogen in wastewater [6]. Inorganic nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient. However, high 
concentrations in water cause eutrophication ; an extreme bloom in the population of plants with 
an enhanced growth period followed by the necr osis of the biomass. The degradation of dead 
plant tissues increases oxygen demand of fresh water, therefore, eutrophication leads to oxygen 
scarcity and decreased self-cleanin g ability of the biomass system [8]. The presence of nitrate 
and nitrite anions in drinking water is blamed for causing cyanotic conditions like shortness of 
breath, methemoglobinemia and blue-baby syndrome [9, 10]. 
To protect human health and aquatic life the ni trogenous contaminants of wastewater must 
be controlled. Table 1 contains some requir ements set up by different governments and 
some typical nitrogen values in different types of wastewater.

2.2. Biological wastewater treatment 
The physicochemical removal of nitrogen from wastewater is possible, however, biological 
methods have proved to be more effect ive and less expensive treatments [15]. 
The biological removal of nitrogen is based on the mixed populations of live bacteria 
naturally present in wastewater which are ab le to convert nitrogen compounds to other 
chemical forms. The mineralization (consecutive steps of ammonification , nitrification  a n d  
denitrification) of the wastewater-derived organic matter provides oxygen, nitrogen and 
energy for the bacteria to produce new cells [16]. 
The activated sludge  formed by these living microorganisms is the core of modern industrial 
wastewater treatment technologies. To ensure the most suitable environmental conditions 
for the microorganisms (e.g. aerobic zone for nitrification and anoxic zone for 
denitrification) several industrial processes have been designed like the Bio-Denitro process , 
modified Ludzack-Ettinger process , Bardenpho process , etc. [15].  
When these conventional wastewater treatmen t facilities are not available – mostly in 
developing countries – stabilization ponds are the most widely used municipal wastewater 
treatment systems [17]. Even if  t h e  c l i m a t e  f a v o u r s  m i c r o b i a l  a c t i v i t y  t h e s e  s t a b i l i z a t i o n  
ponds cannot reduce the concentration of nitrogen satisfactorily [18]. 
2.3. Vegetation filters  
If the high cost of the commercial technologi es discounts the use of sufficient wastewater 
treatment, the unregulated or poorly regulated water turns to a potential risk factor to 
human health and environment [19, 20]. To elimin ate this risk it is crucial to reduce the 
concentration of nitrogen and other pollutants before any effluent reaches the environment.   
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 320 
The application of biological filter systems like soil and vegetation filters  r e p r e s e n t s  a n  
alternative on-site wastewater treatment. While the first pilot tests were carried out by big 
companies to treat cannery effluents, the treatment of municipal water receives more and 
more attention now in developing countries [21, 22]. This type of wastewater management is 
able to reduce the concentration of organic and inorganic contaminants in the water and 
remove 73-97% of the total nitrogen [23]. This low-cost treatment also assimilates nitrogen as 
plant nutrients back into the environment wh ile pathogens from the wastewater cannot 
compete with the natural microbial population of the soil [24, 25].  
3. Nitrogen, the essential plant nutrient 
3.1. Nitrogen in soil  
The role of soil in the biological-cycle is to store and supply nitrogen and other essential 
nutrients for plants. The average amount of or ganic nitrogen in soil is 3300 kg/ha, however, 
the available nitrogen for plants is less than 1 % of the above volume as vegetations are not 
able to uptake any kind of forms of soil nitrogen [26]. 
3.2. Nitrogen uptake in plants  
The synthesis of plant cell components (e.g . amino acids, nucleic acids, enzymes, 
chlorophyll etc.) is unachievable without nitrogen ; nitrogen deficiency in plants causes slow 
growth which can be recognized by the pale green colour of the leaves. Without available 
nitrogen there are no processes in plants [26] . For the formation of new cells, plants uptake 
nitrogen – along with water – in the form of NH 4+ o r  N O 3- d u r i n g  t h e i r  g r o w i n g  p e r i o d  
(assimilation ), or store extra nitrogen ( immobilization ) [27]. 
Nitrogen is being absorbed from soil during th e whole life of the plants but the nitrogen use 
efficiency of plants varies according to th e stage of maturity, se asons, environmental 
conditions of the site and the fertility status of the soil as well [26, 28]. The latter factor is 
particularly important in terms of crop yield as  nitrogen supply is a main limitation factor to 
plant growth [29].  
3.3. Synthetic nitrogenous fertilisers 
If the nitrogen supply within th e soil is not sufficient, land pr oductivity can be improved by 
organic and inorganic (also known as syntheti c) macronutrient plant fertilisers. The most 
widely used synthetic fertilisers are ammonia-ba sed products [30]. The source of nitrogen in 
these fertilisers is the atmosphere containing mo lecular nitrogen in 78 %. The direct reaction 
of molecular nitrogen and molecular hydrogen to NH 3 i s  t h e  b a s e  o f  t h e  w i d e l y  a p p l i e d  
Haber-Bosch process [31] which provides more than 140 million tonnes of ammonia to 
farmers around the world every year [32]. 
Modern soil fertility management in the 20th century has made a significant contribution to 
the growth of Earth’s population which has al most quadrupled since 1900s. To sustain this  
Efforts to Curb NOx from Greenhouse Gases by the Application of Energy Crops and Vegetation Filters 321 
growing population industry produces millions of tons of fertiliser which is responsible for 
more than 1% of the world’s energy consumpt ion. Since hydrocarbon combustion is the 
main energy source of ammonia production, the fe rtiliser industry is a major contributor to 
greenhouse gas emission [33]. In addition to  t h e  e n e r g y  c o n s u m e d  d u r i n g  p r o d u c t i o n  
transportation of the fertilisers is also cont ributing to the world’s greenhouse gas emission 
with 37 Tg CO 2-eq per year [34]. There is also an es timated 2.5-4.5 Tg N emitted from the 
nitrogen-fertilised soil to the atmosphere each year [35].  
3.4. Nitrogen uptake in efflue nt-irrigated short-rotation crops 
If the cost or availability of the technology does not make it possible to apply inorganic 
fertilisers, alternative – and possibly more sustainable – nitrogen sources should be 
considered to increase the productivity of agricultural land. 
Similar to inorganic fertilisers, wastewater is  a source of supplemental nitrogen. According 
to studies, nitrogen uptake of rain-fed Eucaly ptus in New Zealand is in the range of 30-80 
kg/ha/year while the uptake in effluent-irrigated plantations is one magnitude higher [1]. 
During wastewater irrigation, plants uptake ni trogen for their growth and polish the water. 
The absorbed N nutrients are converted to amino acids and stored  i n  w o o d  [ 3 6 ]  o r  
transferred from roots to shoots for protein synt hesis [37]. Research results have also proved 
that plants have enhanced grow ing characteristics as a result of wastewater, grey water or 
effluent irrigation [38-40]. Table 2 shows the in crements in storage an d transport amino acid 
concentrations due to wastewater irrigation.

3.5. Nitrate-leaching 
Even though vegetation has the potential to store wastewater-derived nitrogen, nutrient 
uptake is not the only limitation factor of the land applications of wastewater.  
Due to the metabolism of microorganisms, nitrog en in soil and wastewat er is predominantly 
present in the form of NO 3- a n d  N H 4+, which are readily available plant nutrients. The 
surface charge of clay minerals in soil is ne gative which attaches the wastewater derived 
ammonium ion to soil matrix, but  ions with negative charge are carried by water [41]. Due 
to heavy rains or improper agri cultural activities nitrate nitr ogen can leach below the root 
system of plants into the groundwater with a negative effect both on the environment and

drinking water quality. Nitrate concentratio n in groundwater can reach extremely high 
values; one of the reported Indian examples was 1500 mg nitrate in one litre of water, 150 
times higher than the permi tted value by the WHO [42]. 
Nitrate is a primary pollutant of groundwater. Although chemical reduction, biological 
denitrification and other in-situ treatments of groundwater are feasible [43], nitrate leaching 
is still the main limitation factor of wastew ater irrigation; treatments cannot prevent the 
formation of groundwater contamination or solve the problem of nutrient loss of the soil. 
Without an effective prevention  system the only groundwater protection is source control 
which means the limitation of wastewater loading.  
4. Energy from biomass  
4.1. Heating values  
Treating contaminated water by vegetation f ilters require fast-growing plants, like willow 
[44]. Willow is also a widely cultivated fuel wood for energy applications with an annual 
yield of 9-13 t/ha in Europe [45].  
An important feature of fuelwood and othe r energy crops is their composition which 
determines their heating (or calorific) value [ 46, 47]. The higher heat ing value (HHV) is the 
energy available from the fuel and it is generally  given in units of energy per unit of weight 
(cal/g; J/g or Btu/lb). Table 3 contains some typical heating values of fuelwood and other 
solid fuels. Energy crops can displace approx imately 0.44 tonnes of oil equivalent when 
converted to electricity [48] and contribute to  the reduction of greenhouse gas emission by 
100-2070 Mt CO 2-eq/year [49]. 
The quality characteristics of the biomass have a significant effect on the yield of energy 
during a biochemical or thermochemical conver sion process [50]. For example high oxygen 
and carbon content favours combustion and increases the heating value [51] while the 
general model of heating values predicts a slig ht decrease in HHV when nitrogen content of 
biomass increases [52].

4.2. Biomass combustion and nitrogen liberation 
Nitrogen content of trees ranges between 0.3 and 1 % [57]. Nitrogen in short-rotation plants 
is generally higher and significant differences can be found between species. Short-rotation 
plants represent a cheap and renewable ener gy source with high energy potential. The 
combustion of these plants is also a CO 2 n e u t r a l  e n e r g y  c o n v e r s i o n  t e c h n o l o g y ,  h o w e v e r ,  
combustion converts fuel-nitrogen to nitric oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) and nitrous oxide 
(N 2O) [58-63] which are contributors to acid rain formation [64]. N 2O is also a greenhouse 
gas with a global warming potential  (GWP) of 289 where 1 unit represents the global warming 
potential of CO 2 over 20 years [65]. The emission of NOx contributes to acidification and it 
also causes eutrophication and gr ound-level ozone formation [66]. 
Increased nitrogen content in the biomass al so means increased emission of NOx during 
combustion [67]. The estimated emission of NOx from biomass combustion was 5-5.9 TgN 
in 2000 [35] and based on the fact that the energy demand and the biomass fuel 
consumption are increasing [68], this NOx emi ssion must be even more significant now and 
need to be decreased drastically. 
To control the harmful effects of combustion plants’ pollutants, organisations like 
Environmental Protection Agency  of the United States (US EP A) or the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have elaborated  their guidelines and emission criteria [69, 
70]. The most common way to fulfil these regulations is the application of flue gas cleaning 
systems (primary reduction with excess air, secondary catalytic reduction, etc) [67] but these 
technologies add cost, particularly in small bioenergy facilities. Another effective way to 
reduce the environment impact of biomass-de rived NOx pollution is the application of 
alternative energy conversion technologies  with better emission characteristics. 
5. Pyrolysis 
5.1. Biomass conversion to so lid, liquid and gas products 
Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process wher e the biomass (e.g. energy crop) is being 
converted into more effective energy sour ces. During the pyrolysis process the 
macromolecules and biopolymers of the biom ass undergo a thermal degradation in the 
absence of oxygen, which leads to so lid, liquid and gaseous products.  
The thermal decomposition and conversion can be interpreted as the independent 
degradation of the three main organic woody biomass compounds, cellulose, hemicellulose 
and lignin [71, 72] which have an average ra tio of 45/24/28 wt % in softwood and 45/31/21 
wt % in hardwood, resp ectively [53]. The few parentage of wood inorganics remains in the 
solid product of pyrolysis while the lignocellulosic compounds undergo thermal 
degradation.  
The biomass conversion at different pyrolysis temperatures can be followed by the 
thermal degradation and the weight loss of the main wood compounds on Fig. 2. The  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 324 
ratio of the gases, vapours and solid products  depend on the temperature, residence time 
and heating rate of pyrolysis [73, 74]. Incr easing the highest treatment temperature of 
pyrolysis increases the liquid and gas yields and decreases char yield (Fig 3). Due to 
secondary reactions of vapours liquid yield has a maximum which is followed by a 
reduction at higher temperatures and the gas yield increases at the expense of biochar 
yield [73, 75]. 
In terms of nitrogen oxide emission, pyrolysis is a more desirable energy conversion 
technology than combustion; while biomass comb ustion releases fuel-nitrogen in the form 
of NOx, the inert atmosphere of pyrolysis does  not favour to the formation of these or any 
other oxidized pollutants [76]. 
5.2. Pyrolysis liquids (bio-oil) ȱ
Pyrolysis has the ability to generate highly energetic bio-oil which represents most of the 
energy content of wood (Fig. 4) with the addition al benefit that it can be easily pumped or 
transported. Another advantage of the bio-oil from energy crops and vegetation filters is 
the lack of jeopardy to the security of food supply, unlike the dangers of sugar-, starch- 
and vegetable oil-based conventional bio-fuels –which conquer valuable agriculture lands 
[77]. 
Bio-oil is still a relatively new energy source and its energy applications are still developing, 
but its combustion in boilers, turbines and en gines has been successfully used for heat and 
electricity production [78, 79]. Table 4 cont ains some typical power output values.

5.3. Nitrogen in biochar and in pyrolysis gases 
Biochar and biomass char are the solid co-product s of the pyrolysis process. They are mainly 
made of carbon and the ash content of the biom ass. Despite of their similarities, historical 
definitions distinguish biochar  from biomass char  which is also known as charcoal . While the 
latter has been produced and used as fuel for he at for centuries, the former belongs to a new 
concept of soil management and carbon  s e q u e s t r a t i o n  [ 8 0 ] .  O t h e r  n a m e s  l i k e  black carbon , 
dark earth  (terra preta) or agrichar  can be also fined in literature.  
Enrichment of the fuel-bound nitrogen of biom ass occurs in the biochar independently from 
the applied pyrolysis technique [81]. Nitrogenous gases (e.g. ammonia, hydrogen 
cyanide and isocyanic acid) are released during pyrolysis, but only at high temperature. The 
ration of these main gaseous ni trogen products depending on both the type of biomass and 
the conditions of the pyrolysis process [76] . Nitrogen-free gases le ave the system when 
pyrolysis temperature is increased which resu lts nitrogen depletion in char at high 
temperatures [81]. However, low pyrolysis te mperature does not favour the liberation of 
fuel nitrogen therefore most of the nitr ogen (approximately 60-75 % at 500 °C) remains 
captured in the char [72, 76, 82].  
 
Efforts to Curb NOx from Greenhouse Gases by the Application of Energy Crops and Vegetation Filters 327 
The nitrogen functionalities in biochar are pyrrolic -N, pyridinic -N, quaternary -N and amines 
[83-85] and incubation tests evidenced that  t h e s e  s t a b l e  n i t r o g e n  f o r m s  w i t h  l o w  
bioavailability [86]. 
6. Biochar properties 
6.1. Biochar as a fuel 
Due to its high fixed carbon content biochar is a renewable energy source with a heating 
value up to 30-35 MJ/kg [87]. Biomass char  h a s  h i g h e r  e n e r g y  d e n s i t y  a n d  b e t t e r  
combustibility properties than traditional bioma ss, and higher reactivity than coal due to its 
oxygen content [88] and its incoherent carbon  s t r u c t u r e  [ 8 9 ] .  T h e  c o m b u s t i o n  o f  b i o m a s s  
char is able to displace traditional fuels, however, the combustion of biochar recycles 
atmospheric CO 2 and liberates the char-b ond N in the form of NOx without the benefit of 
carbon or nitrogen sequestration. 
According to different estimations biomass pyrolysis with soil applications of the biochar 
has a negative greenhouse gas emission – with a CO 2 equivalent ranging from few hundred 
kg up to a few tonnes of CO 2eq t-1 dry biomass  – with a positive net energy [90-92]. A detailed 
calculation and complete life cycle assessment  of biochar can be found in the work of 
Roberts at et al [90]. 
6.2. Biochar as a soil amendment 
The most widely acknowledged benefit of biochar’s soil applications is its long-term carbon 
sequestration potential [90, 93]. Other potentials of biochar is stimulation of N 2 fixation and 
the biological transformation of nitrogen in soil [94-96]. 
Biochar is also known for the ability to contribute to soil properties by changing its physical 
and chemical characteristics. The most important physicochemical properties of biochar are 
directly related to the type of the bioma ss used for char production and the applied 
temperature of pyrolysis [55, 97] therefore biochar contribution to soil quality factors can be 
both positive and negative [98, 99]. By sele cting the right feedstock, setting the right 
pyrolysis conditions and elaborately characteri sing the physicochemical properties, char can 
be applied to soil as an amendment. 
The pyrolysis temperature related structural chan ges of biochar can be seen on the infrared 
absorption spectra of Fig. 5. Comparing these sp ectra it can be seen that char gradually loses 
its structural complexity at higher pyrolysis temperatures as wood carbonisation becomes 
more completed. Char samples prepared at 300 °C and 400 °C show dr amatic decreases in 
intensity in almost all functional groups; this is the temperature range in which the majority 
of the pyrolysis mass loss of wood occurs due to the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose 
and lignin. Hemicellulose peak at 1736 cm-1 becomes undetectable in char prepared at 400 °C 
but the O – H (3413 cm-1) and CH n related vibrations (2956, 2924, 2851 cm-1) show dramatic 
decreases in char prepared at higher te mperatures (400 – 600 °C) where the thermal 
degradation of cellulose is already completed.  Pyrogenic char (prepared at 700 °C or over)  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 328 
has no measured transmittance due to the lack of organic functionalities and the disordered 
carbon structure. 
 
The first strong broad band between 3700 and 3000 cm-1 of dried willow (100  and 200  °C) is the stretching vibrations of 
O – H functional groups. In the region of 2975-2840 cm-1 the unresolved group of medium weak bands is related to C – 
H stretching vibrations of CH n groups. The peak at 1736 cm-1 is assigned to the absorption of free carbonyl groups, 
therefore it is a typical hemicellulose mark er [112, 113]. Bands around 1600 and 1500 cm-1 are generally considered as 
lignin markers as this is the region of the sk eletal vibrations of aromatic rings [114].

Figure 5. Changes in the infrared spectra of biochar obtained at different pyrolysis temperatures 
The functional groups on biochar surface determine the pH and the cation exchange 
capacity and the nutrient retention in soil [ 100, 101]. The pH also has an impact on the 
mobility of ions and affects soil microbial activity [102]. 
As well as the changes of biochar surface, th e increasing pyrolysis treatment temperature 
also increases C content, decreases H and O co ntent and increases the ash content in char 
[103] . These changes in char composition increase hydrophobicity [99] and aromaticity [103]. 
Hydrophobicity and aromaticity play a major ro le in the future stability of biochar in soil 
[103] and the estimated half-life of char with  O/C over 0.2 is 100-1000 year and greater than 
1000 years in case of char when O/ C is smaller than 0.2 [104].  
The composition changes in the carbonised ch ar is also accompanied by changes in the 
physical appearance of the biochar; Pyrolysi s vapours can develop pores in biochar [105] 
 
Efforts to Curb NOx from Greenhouse Gases by the Application of Energy Crops and Vegetation Filters 329 
The increased porosity affects the water-holdin g capacity of soil and the surface area – a 
shelter for microorganism [97]; bulk density, which affects the pore size distribution of soil 
and the conditions for gas exchange [106]; and total dissolved solids, which give an 
estimation on the amount of the mobile charged ions, migrating from char to soil [80].  
Due to the high specific surface and adsorbent capacity, biochar can increase the water and 
nutrient retention capacity of the soil [107, 108] while a biochar buffer layer in soil can 
reduce both nitrate leaching and gaseous loss of soil nitrogen [107, 109]. Improved nitrogen 
recovery in soil will directly result in increased plant growth. 
Biochar properties are strongly affected by the pyrolysis temperature [97, 110] which makes 
possible to design biochar, remediate specific soil issues and realise a new type of soil 
management [99, 111]. 
7. Conclusions  
Nitrogen always has been the “weakest link” in the food chain and agriculture. Without 
additional nitrogen the present capacity of Eart h’s topsoil is not able to satisfy our hunger 
for biomass for food or energy. 
Wastewater is a valuable source of nitrog en but nitrate leaching is harmful for 
groundwaters and results in nutrient lost from  t h e  s o i l .  P l a n t s  c u l t i v a t e d  f o r  w a s t e w a t e r  
treatment can be considered as energy crops and bring land back into economic use.  
To obtain an economically attractive feedstoc k for energy conversion applications, efforts 
should be made to maximise the utilisation of the sources (land, irrigation water etc) and the 
energy gained from the biomass with a mi nimum environmental impact. Pyrolysis of 
wastewater irrigated energy crops offers the adva ntages in both fields, therefore it is an 
excellent candidate to supply green energy for rural areas in developing countries while the 
soil application of biochar can retain and assi milate the wastewater derived nitrogen back 
into the environment.  
x In terms of the nitrogen-cycle, biomass comb ustion liberates 5-5.9 Tg of NOx-N each 
year into the atmosphere. However, the cu ltivation of wastewater irrigated energy 
crops and the pyrolysis of the vegetation filters have the potential to reduce the 
emission of NOx-N and other greenhouse gases the following ways: 
x Vegetation filters reduce the concentration of water contaminants and lower nitrogen 
content by 97%. Wastewater can provide nitrog en and nutrients for plants and increase 
biomass yield without the application of inorganic soil fertilisers. 
x Energy crops can uptake wastewater derived nitrogen and double the concentration of 
the storage amino acids. 
x Compare to traditional combustion the pyro lysis of energy crops does not favour the 
formation of NOx.  
x Pyrolysis captures 60-75% of the biomass de rived nitrogen in the biochar. The soil 
applications of the biochar provide a long-t erm nitrogen sequestration and reduce the 
amount of the reactive nitrogen forms whic h accompany the traditional water treatment 
processes.

1. Introduction 
According to the American Energy Inform ation Administration (EIA) and to the 
International Energy Agency (IEA), the worl d-wide energy consumption will on average 
continue to increase by 2% per year. A yearly  i n c r e a s e  b y  2 %  l e a d s  t o  a  d o u b l i n g  o f  t h e  
energy consumption every 35 years ( Michaelbluejay, 2012 ). This means the world-wide 
energy consumption is predicted to be twice as high in the year 2047 compared to today 
(2012) which is about 2500 GW of capacity 35 years from now. Current global consumer 
electronics devices (TV and PC etc.) account for roughly 15% residential electricity usage 
annually and are growing. Nearly 185 GW of capacity is consumed. About 370 medium size 
(500 MW) power plants are required. Estimated 650 megaton’s of CO2 emissions per year 
today and could surpass 1000 megaton’s by 2030 without policy intervention. With the switch 
and design architecture changed from 2-D to 3-D for all TV and PC electronics devices the 
energy consumption could be reduced to the tenth of the current consumed capacity which is 
about 18 GW of capacity today only ( Cheng, K., 2011 ). This could save about 600 megaton’s of 
CO2 emissions per year today. 37 medium si ze (500 MW) power plants are needed only 
instead of 370 power plants ( Massoud Pedram, 2009; Noah Horowitz, 2011 ). 
From the recent study, it is learnt that 3-dimensional electronics integrated circuit device  
(3-D IC) and 3-dimensional computing syst ems (3-D Computer) will be the ultimate 
architecture for all our daily used electronic s equipments such as TV, PC, cell phone, PDA 
and GPS devices etc. because of the 3 dimensiona l integrated circuit has the benefit of small 
size, light weight, high speed and less power consumption to meet the global warming 
regulation. No PCB, no packag e and even no cable connector are needed in the future 3 
dimensional computer system. It has been prov ed in the laboratory that the 3 dimensional 
computing systems consumed only about one seventh to one tenth of that of the 2  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 338 
dimensional counterparts. In the next few years to  come each of us will have a mobile device 
such as i-phone or tablet computer to carry wi th all the time. This means the number of the 
device needed is about the popula tion of the world. Therefore, it  is vital urgent to turn all 
the current 2 dimensional computing system to  t h e  3  d i m e n s i o n a l  a r c h i t e c t u r e .  T h i s  w i l l  
lead to the seven to ten times of power saving and will benefit to our environment by using 
less carbon and meet the global warming regulation.       
The era of cloud computing is near and beco ming more reality for us. More business 
organizations are taking the instant tremendous  large volume of data from cloud computing 
to analyze and direct their business orientatio n for profit consideration. For the private 
section to guide their investment for instant profit is becoming more reality by manipulating 
the instant data information provided from th e cloud computing. The advantage of the cloud 
computing technology is the tremendous large in stant data base available for public. Handling 
this large amount of instant data into your loca l need is one of the biggest challenges of this 
new era. In order to quickly process the data obtained from the cloud, a local smart terminal 
computing system is required. An example of a cloud computing terminal is an advanced GPS 
device. Live traffic information ca n be processed in real time such that alternate routes can be 
derived. Such smart terminals required for this application could be further advanced by 
applying 3 dimensional computing systems. Th is means in the near future era of cloud 
computing these smart terminals are needed almost every corner of the world. Again, it is vital 
urgent to turn all the current 2 dimensional computing system to the 3 dimensional 
architecture which will cut down the residential power requirement of electronic gadgets from 
15% to 1.5%-2.1% and would help in reduction of power requirement substantially and 
approximately 600 megaton’s of CO2 emissions per year could be saved on the basis of current 
data. It would thus protect our environment by using less carbon and meet the global 
warming regulation if all the electronics equipments are switched to 3-D. Source: (Latest 
industry research & analysis; Prediction of energy consumption world-wide ).  
2. Construction features of 2-d to 3-d integrated circuit devices 
A 2-dimensional (2-D) system chip or device, for instance, may consist of 5 elements as 
shown in the Fig. 1 -a. This system can be partitioned and then stacked up to form a 3-
dimensional (3-D) system chip or device with the same functionality as shown in Fig. 1 -c. 
Fig. 1 -d is also a 3-D but sometime it is named 2.5-D because only small portion of the whole 
system are stacked up to form a 3-D.  As can be seen is that the global wirings (wirings 
between elements) shown in orange color in Fig. 1 -b are much longer than the global 
wirings shown in Fig. 1 -d, i.e. the wirings in 3-D system are much shorter than the 2-D’s. 
With the shorter wirings the system may functi oning more efficiency. Besides, it consumes 
less power too. 
In general, the power for IC circuit can be  expressed as in the following equation: 
 S y s t e m  P o w e r  c o n s u m p t i o n  䴼  C•V•V•f    (1) 
where C=capacitance, V=voltage swing, f=frequency of operation.  Impact of Uses of 3-Dimensonal Electronics IC Devices and  
Computing Systems on the Power Consumptions and Global Warming Issues 339 
So the advantage of consumed less power in 3-D comes from the smaller capacitance due to 
the reduced size and length of the interconnection among the system.  
 
Figure 1.  2-D IC Device converted to 2.5-D or 3-D IC Device 
2-D IC system as described in Fig.1 -a can be partitioned more and form a totally 3-D IC 
system device or chip ( Fig. 1 -c) with all 5 elements stacked vertically into 5 layers. With the 
same token, stacking up more of the same or different functioning 3-D IC chips vertically 
will finally become a complete close-up system, a 3D-Computer as shown in Fig. 2  below. 
The form factor (size and weight) of the 3- D computer system is much compacted and 
smaller than its 2-D counterpart. 
Fig. 2  s h o w s  t h e  3  s y s t e m s ;  2 - D  I C ,  3 - D  I C  a n d the 3-D Computer. According to the lab 
experimental results indicated that the 2.5-D IC  with only portion of the system stacked to 
form a 3-D IC device like the one in Fig. 1 -d, the power consumption is about 3 quarter of 
that 2-D IC counterpart. With more detail part itioning and stacking into more layers as 
shown in Fig. 2, the 3-D Computer, the power consumed by this 3-D Computer system is 
only one seventh or one tenth of the 2-D counte rpart. The experimental results [1] have been 
performed in the lab as shown in Table 1  below:

System with Wafer Scale VLSI ~0.012 ~6 ~0.95 
System with Multi-Wafers Stacked VLSI (3-D Computer) ~0.003 ~1 ~0.14 
Table 1.  Power Consumption Comparison betw een 2-D and 3-D Computer system 
From the above Table 1 , the size, weight and power of 3-D Computer are at most 
(0.003/0.012=)1/4 in size, 1/6 in weight and (0 .14/0.95=)1/7 in power as compared with the 
other 2-D Computer counterparts. 
The system power consumption as stated in the above equation (1) is also proportional to the 
voltage swing, V. With the system stacked in a very compact form like that in 3-D Computer 
system, the voltage swing actually can be redu ced to a point where the logic states, “1” and 
“0” is still valid. Supposed the voltage swing of th e 3-D Computer can be reduced to half then 
the power consumption will be reduced to the fact or of 4. Therefore, the power consumed by 
the 3-D computing system could reduce almost to one 4x7 䴼thirtieth and beyond. This is a very 
optimal way of saving the power. This concluded that the system must go  3-D in order to save 
power consumption and meet the global warming regulation. 
3. Signal, Information processing and Super Computer Architecture of 3-
D IC 
In this section the power of 3-D IC signal an d information processing is described by some 
sample applications. 3-D IC's will have the advantage of parallel processing over its 2-D IC 
Impact of Uses of 3-Dimensonal Electronics IC Devices and  
Computing Systems on the Power Consumptions and Global Warming Issues 341 
counterpart which will lead to better image, signal and data processing ( Little, M.J.,1989; 
Toborg, S.T., 1990; Boguslaw  C. et al., 2009; Orion Jo nes, 2012; Sarah Perrin, 2012 ).  
The main technologies for integrating and fa bricating the 3D-IC device and system are: 
i. Through Silicon Via (TSV) technolo gy for vertical communication;  
ii. Interconnecting technology to accomplish th e up and down signal flow between wafer 
layers and 
iii. Stacking technology to complete the final as sembly of the 3D-IC device and system.  
The 3-D IC fabrication technology and its manufacturing processes are becoming more 
mature now-a-days. The TSV and the multi-layer wafers stacking technologies are going to 
be more prevalent in the manufacturing in dustry. These advancing techniques are now 
providing an opportunity for the integrated circuit industry to advance in an optimal circuit 
design using 3-D IC's. The advantages of the 3-D IC design are what we always strive for in  
IC manufacturing, that is, smaller sizes, lighter weights and less power consumption. 
Most of the micro-processor ( ΐP) currently used in all computing system is 2-D. With the 
advancement of the TSV, wafer to wafer interco nnection and stacking technologies in 3-D IC 
manufacturing, it is possible to produce the 3-D ΐP at relatively easy and low cost. What 
will be the different between the 2-D and 3-D ΐP is that the processing algorithm and the 
circuit design architecture. Wi th the implementation of SIMA (Single Instruction Multiple 
Data) and BSWP (Bit Serial Word Para llel) processing te chnologies, a 3-D ΐP or super 
computer can be designed to execute the data  signal paralleling while the conventional 2-D 
is sequentially. Therefore, the power of the 3-D signal processing could be tremendously 
better than that of the 2-D version ( Singh, A.  D.,  1985 ). 
The 2-D conventional microprocessor is consisted by 5 processing cells as shown in the Fig. 
3. These 5 processing cells can be st acked up vertically to form a 3-D ΐP as shown in Fig. 4 . 
We could turn this single 3-D ΐP into multiple or wafer scale 3-D high performance 
microprocessor easily as shown in Fig. 5 . This wafer scale 3-D microprocessor could be the 
ultimate high performance processor or super computer we are searching for. 
With multiple identical N x N cells on the sa me level of wafer and stacked with other 4 
different types of cell wafer will lead to an N x N processors. Each processor can process its 
own instruction or data signal and all N x N di fferent instructions are executed parallel in 
the same time frame. Fig. 6  shows a complete 3-D multiple micro-processor system or 3-D 
super computer. The data signal can go horizont ally and vertically in this 5 wafers stack. 
This 3-D IC design architecture constructed a very powerful N x N processor.  For example, 
let’s assume this is a 16 bits word processor. The data on any level of wafer with N x N cells 
are transmitted to the other level of wafer pa ralleling through the TSV inter-connected link 
between levels then executed according to the instruction paralleling. This process is called 
“words parallel” because the entire N x N data  o r  i n s t r u c t i o n s  i s  p r o c e s s e d  o r  e x e c u t e d  
parallel in the same time. If there is only on e TSV for each cell to communicate to the other 
level, then the 16 bits will be shifted bit by bit through the single TSV and therefore we call it 
“bit serial” because shifting the word to other level of wafer is bit by bit sequentially.

The command for this BSWP (bit serial word parallel) is instructed by a single instruction 
and the operation is performed on all N x N data  in the same time. Therefore, we called it 
SIMA (single instruction multiple data) operation. For example: 
SHIFT A TO C; 
ADD DATA; 
MOVE DATA TO D; 
The above 3 single instructions will do: 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 344 
i. shift the data on A level of wafer through TSV to the C level 
ii. do the adding on all N x N data of A with C 
iii. The results of N x N data will be moved to I/O which is D wafer level and accessed to 
outside world such as printer etc… 
With the concept of BSWP and SIMD techno logies a super high performance computer 
could be achieved to enhance the 3-D IC design  architecture. Theoretically the N could be a 
very large number approaching to the infi nite and the system performance could be 
tremendously powerful. But in reality the ma nufacturing encountered the yield and fault 
tolerance problem. Redundancy and Interposer technologies could be applied to the circuit 
design for enhancing the yield and fault tolerance to make the dream system come true. 
Wafers with new function type of cell can be added to the stack randomly to expand the 
system because the system can be re-configured by built-in software after stacking. Fig. 7  
indicated the relative manufacturing cost per sy stem with the size of N x N array related to 
the number of stacked wafers in that system  w i l l  b e c o m e  c h e a p e r  a s  t h e  a d v a n c e m e n t  i n  
TSV and inter-connection technologies  in the next few years to come.

3.1. 3-D Computer for Image Understanding Application 
Image understanding technology has broad applic ation. Especially on Today’s LCD display 
panel and LED lighting device production, it can be applied to test and evaluate the quality 
of the display panel and lighting products. Fo r the industrial applications such as bin 
picking, assembly and inspection, image understanding technology can be used to support 
those applications at real-time rates. Another area of applicability is that of automatic 
interpretation of aerial or satellite imagery fo r use in GPS or computer aided cartography. 
Impact of Uses of 3-Dimensonal Electronics IC Devices and  
Computing Systems on the Power Consumptions and Global Warming Issues 345 
IC design for machine vision and image unders tanding is one of the most computationally 
intensive domains of artificial intelligence resear ch. It requires that an interpretation of the 
changing scene be updated with every new vide o frame, once every thirtieth of a second. 
With three quarters of a million color-intens ity data values which comprise the picture 
elements or pixels of the image, performing a single operation on each of these pixels 
requires an execution rate of about twenty-three million instructions per second for just to 
keep up with the input. Of course far more than one operation per pixel is necessary. The 
image understanding is not limited to the data processing in the visible spectrum; it should 
have more applicable to computer aided systems for image signal processing such as 
avionics flight control, synthetic array radar and sonar systems etc... The bandwidth 
requirement of these systems is even high er. In order to achieve these enormous 
bandwidths a 3-D IC parallel processing desi gn architecture and its algorithm will be 
discussed. With the advancement of the high  d e n s i t y  p a c k a g i n g  a n d  t h e  l e v e l  o f  3 - D  I C  
integration technologies available today, it  m a y b e  t h e  b e s t  a p p r o a c h  t o  a c h i e v e  t h e s e  
bandwidths by implementing the SIMD (Singl e Instruction Multiple Data) and the BSWP 
(Bit Serial Word Parallel) proc essing technologies into the 3- D IC circuitry. The SIMD and 
the BSWP will be discussed and analyzed as  approaches to achieving these enormous 
bandwidths requirement for machine vision and image understanding. 
The era of cloud computing is near. The advantage of the cloud computing technology is the 
tremendous large instant data base available for public. How to handle this large amount of 
instant data into your local need is one of the most challenges of this new era. In order to 
quickly manipulating the instant data obtain ed from the cloud computing to meet your 
instant need, a local smart termin al computer is required to take the advantage of the cloud 
computing. 3-D data processing architecture is believed to be the best candidate for this 
smart terminal computing requirement. 
4. SIMD and BSWP technologies 
With the advancement of the TSV (Through Sili con Via), wafer to wafer interconnection and 
stacking technologies in 3-D IC manufacturin g, it is possible to produce the 3-D smart 
computer to meet the requirement of the clou d computing at relatively easy and low cost. 
What will be the different between the 2-D and 3-D computer is that the processing 
algorithm and the circuit design architecture . With the implementati on of SIMD (Single 
Instruction Multiple Data) and BSWP (Bit Serial Word Parallel) processing technologies, a 3-
D smart computer can be designed to exec ute the data signal paralleling while the 
conventional 2-D is sequentially . Therefore, the power of the 3-D signal processing could be 
tremendously better than that of the 2-D ve rsion. Although the TSV and the micro-bump 
technologies developed for stacking the silicon  chips or wafers are quite advance now, but 
the vertical interconnection or wiring density is  still significantly lower than in the other two 
dimensions. Thus, it is still important to partition the system to make best use of the limited 
vertical dimension in the 3-D IC circuit design.  
The MEMS technology applied to form the vertic al connection, i.e. TSV and wafer to wafer 
interconnection, is still in the micron geometri cs while the 2-D surface wiring is now in the  
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 346 
nanometer technology. There are a million or ders of magnitude different between the 
vertical and horizontal wiring connection. With the limited bandwidth for the vertical 
interconnection as compared with the other two dimensions how to optimize the 3-D IC 
circuit design architecture becomes the most popular issue. .  
DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etcher) or Bosch process is the most popular one used in 
processing the TSV. The aspect ratio can be re ached to the maximum of 13:1 so far. For 3-D 
stacked chip or wafer the thinnest silicon chip or wafer can be archived now are about 50 
um. With the aspect ratio of 13:1 the smallest  d i a m e t e r  o f  t h r o u g h  s i l i c o n  h o l e  i s  a b o u t  
3.85um in diameter. It is truly a waste on the wa fer surface if this 3.85 um diameter area has 
to be taken by the TSV. Therefore, the less number of vertical interconnections the more 
circuit could be deposited on the wafer surface.  
Take for example ; a 2-D conventional microprocessor is formed by 5 processing cells as shown 
in the Fig. 3 . The interconnections between the cells are mostly data bus and a few control 
signals. In order to save the physical silicon sp ace on each chip level after stacking them up 
to form a 3-D structure, a single wire connection is designed to connect the 5 cells vertically 
thru each of the 5 chip levels.  These 5 processing cells each on  5 different levels are stacked 
up vertically to form a 3-D microprocessor as shown in Fig. 4 . The vertical connection is 
limited to one single wire in order to save the silicon space on each of the silicon chip level. 
Communication between levels is now can only go thru the single vertical connection wire. 
In order for the data and a few control signals to go thru the single channel a special shift 
register circuit must be installed on each cell of the 5 levels. So that  signals from a cell can 
pass thru the single vertical channel to the othe r cell on the different level sequentially. If the 
data or the control signal is a 16 bit wide wo rd then the 16 bits will be passed one by one 
consecutively thru the vertical interconnection wire. By the same token the receiving cell 
will need to have the similar shift registers to get it back to the original data and signals. 
If a system contains more than a single processor, i.e. a multiple N*N microprocessors 
system, then it can be expanded to an N x N multiple processors system on 5 full size wafers 
stacked vertically (wafer scale) as shown in the Fig. 5 . The transfer of the data signals of the 
system can be performed simultaneously on the all N x N cells on the same level to the other 
level of N x N cells correspondingly. After the da ta been transferred to the designated level 
then all the data signals in the N x N cells wi ll be performed and executed paralleling in the 
same time on the designated level. This bit by bit way of transferring the data signals 
sequentially between the wafer levels and exec uting all the N x N cells data signals on the 
designated level in a parallel fashion is called BSWP technology. Because an adaptive multi-
microprocessors message passing network make s better use of limited bandwidth than any 
other communication structure we know of, the natural vertical partition in the packaging is 
likely to match one dimension of the message network.  
Based on the above criteria it is suggested that  the BSWP (bit serial word parallel) and the 
SIMD (single instruction multiple data) technologies applied to the 3-D circuit design, 
together with the circuit partition technique for less interconnection may be a more desired 
approach for the design of a better circuit performance in regards to limited vertical 
interconnection bandwidth. Impact of Uses of 3-Dimensonal Electronics IC Devices and  
Computing Systems on the Power Consumptions and Global Warming Issues 347 
 
Figure 8.  Tri-state I/O Buffer 
Up to this point questions will be raised for ho w the cells on a level can transfer their data 
signals to the designated level or levels; and how the cells on a level or levels can receive data 
signals from other level without interfering. Th is is done by the so called wired-AND scheme 
or tri-state I/O buffer circuit connected to the si ngle vertical interconnection wire as shown in 
the Fig. 8 . Supposed data signals on level 1 are going to transfer to level 3 and/or 4. The path 
between level 1 and level 3 and/or 4 will be open  for transfer data signals while other levels 
will be in tri-state or “Z” state.  S o m e t i m e  t h e  t r i - s t a t e  o r  “ Z ”  s t ate is referred to electrical 
potentially “floating” state because it is in the high impedance state condition. 
5. Example of image understanding by implementing BSWP and SIMD 
3 types of cells array are needed for this exampl e and all the cells data are assumed to be the 
16-bit shift register with 2 bytes word. Each sing le cell is a simple logic circuit with only few 
hundred gates count and all N x N cells on a wa fer level has the identical circuit. This will 
simplify the circuit design trem endously. Type 1 as shown in Fig. 9  is the N x N cells array 
data that can be shifted right and left, up and down and wraparound and is named 
SHIFTER, which in this example is the B wafer level as shown in Fig. 10 . Type 2 is the N x N 
cells array data that can do the “XNOR” operation and is named COMPARATOR, which in 
this example is the C wafer level as shown in  Fig. 10. The data of this COMPARATOR can 
only communicate vertically. Type 3 is the N x N cells array data that can be loaded and 
unloaded to and from the I/O bus and is name d DATA I/O, which in this example is the D 
wafer level as shown in Fig. 10 . The rest of the wafers levels are data base for many kinds of 
 
Global Warming – Impacts  and Future Perspective 348 
images. Let’s assumed DATA-1 is the image of a ball; DATA-2 is the image of a bird and 
DATA-3 is the image of an airplane etc… All the cells array data can be communicated 
vertically of course. Fig. 10 shows a simple system for this example which contained all 3 
types of wafer levels and the images data base . In order to have better picture of how the 
image understanding will work, ta ke for an example as below: 
 
Figure 9.  3 Types of Cells Array 
Assuming the pilot of a commercial airline saw a spot far ahead. It could be an airplane 
heading toward him. Supposed the pilot has an image understanding equipment similar to 
the one shown in Fig. 10 . The spot (image) picture was taken by a digital camera that 
connected to the system. The first thing will be  done is to center the spot and magnify (or 
zoom) it to the suitable size for image proc essing: Assuming the image is already at the 
center and zoomed to the right size by the digital camera, and then the following simple 
instructions program will do the target recognition: 
 
MOVE D TO B step 1 
SHIFT B RIGHT-LEFT step 2 
SHIFT B UP-DOWN  step 3 
MOVE B TO C   step 4 
FOR i=1 TO 3 step 5 
MOVE DATA-i TO C step 6 
PERFORM COMPARE  step 7 
IF C = “1” THEN step 8 
PRINT “IT’S AN AIRPLANE” step 9 
END ELSE NEXT i step 10 
Table 2.  10 single instructions 
The above 10 single instructions as shown in Table 2 , will do: 
Step 1  Image data has been loaded to D level from  I/O Bus. Therefore this step is to move 
the image data in D level to B level (because the B wafer level can do right-left, up-
down and wraparound shifting) 
Impact of Uses of 3-Dimensonal Electronics IC Devices and  
Computing Systems on the Power Consumptions and Global Warming Issues 349 
Step 2, 3  will do the fine adjustment for the image to be right on the center with the right 
size. 
Step 4  then move the image on B to C ready to be compared 
Step 5  indicates the program will do at most 3 ti mes of comparison because system has only 
3 images data as exampled. 
Step 6  will move the system image data from DA TA-1 to C level where C will perform the 
“XNOR” operation as shown on top of Fig. 11. 
Step 7  is ordering the C level to perform the “X NOR” manipulation as shown in the Fig. 11 
(1), (2) and (3). 
Step 8  is to compare the resultant data whether it  has all “1” in the N x N array as shown in 
the Fig. 11 (1), (2) and (3). 
Step 9  is the end of the program if all the cells data in the N x N array are “1” then the image 
is understood to be Data-3 which is an airplane as shown in the Fig. 11 (3) results 
marked with red. 
Step 10  is for continuing the manipulation if the image is still not recognized. 
 
Figure 10.  Architecture of 3-D Processor System 
The example shown above imply the BSWP an d SIMD technologies been applied to 
accomplish the mission at lightening speed. Th e single instruction contained “MOVE” in 
step 1, 4 and 6 for moving the N x N data from the wafer level to the destination level are all 
manipulated by the BSWP technology which th e 2-D computer system can hardly do. The 
single instruction contained “SHIFT” and “PER FORM” are actually manipulating the entire 
N x N data in the same time which again the 2-D computer system can never do. In the 2-D 
system, the pixel of the entire N x N data is  p e r f o r m e d  i n  s e q u e n t i a l l y  w h i l e  i n  o u r  3 - D

x The power consumption of the 3-D computer system is about one tenth (1/10) to one 
seventh (1/7) of that of the 2-D computer system counterpart based on the lab 
experimental results. The 3-D will be qualified for environmental issue and meet the 
global warming limits. 
It is also assessed that once 2-D IC is swiched to 3-D IC pertaining to all the electronic 
domestic appliances and or eq uipments, 3 Dimensional Architec ture Integrated  Circuits will 
cut down the residential power requirements from 15% to 2.1% to 1.5% and would help in 
reduction of power requirement substantially . Apperently 600 megaton’s of CO2 emissions 
per year could be saved on the basis of current data of EIA. It would thus protect our 
environmental issues to some extent by us ing less carbon and meet the global warming 
regulation.
